## How is breast cancer staged?

Cancer staging is used to reflect prognosis and to guide treatment decisions. It describes the size and location of the tumor and if cancer has spread to lymph nodes, organs, or other parts of the body. It also takes into account hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 status and standard-of-care treatment results.

A cancer stage is a way to describe the extent of the cancer at the time you are first diagnosed. Based on testing, your cancer will be assigned a stage. Staging helps to predict prognosis and is needed to make treatment decisions. A prognosis is the course your cancer will likely take.

Information gathered during staging:

  * **The extent (size) of the tumor (T):** How large is the cancer? Has it grown into nearby areas?
  * **The spread to nearby lymph nodes (N):** Has the cancer spread to nearby lymph nodes? If so, how many? Where?
  * **The spread (metastasis) to distant sites (M):** Has the cancer spread to distant organs such as the lungs or liver?
  * **Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) tumor status:** Does the cancer have the protein called an estrogen or progesterone receptor?
  * **Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) tumor status:** Does the cancer make too much of a protein called HER2?
  * **Grade of the cancer (G):** How much do the cancer cells look like normal cells?
  * **Biomarker testing:** Does the cancer have any genes, proteins, markers, or mutations that might suggest treatment?

Staging is based on a combination of information to reach a final numbered stage. It takes into account what can be felt during a physical exam, what can be seen on imaging tests, and what is found during a biopsy or surgery. Often, not all information is available at the initial evaluation. More information can be gathered as treatment begins.

Staging includes:

  * **Anatomic** – based on extent of cancer as defined by tumor size (T), lymph node status (N), and distant metastasis (M).
  * **Prognostic** – includes anatomic TNM plus tumor grade and the status of the biomarkers such as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PR). Prognostic stage also includes the assumption that you are treated with the standard of care approaches.

Breast cancer staging is often done twice, before and after surgery. Staging after surgery provides more specific and accurate details about the size of the cancer and lymph node status.

## Clinical stage

Clinical stage (c) is the rating given before any treatment. An example might look like cT1 or cN2. In breast cancer, the clinical stage is based on imaging and biopsy results. These tests are done before any treatment as part of an initial diagnosis.

## Pathologic stage

Pathologic stage (p) or surgical stage is determined by examining tissue removed during surgery. The pathologic stage and clinical stage may be different, if imaging was not completely accurate. If you are given drug therapy before surgery, then the stage might look like ypT2.

## TNM scores

The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system is used to stage breast cancer. In this system, the letters T, N, and M describe different areas of cancer growth. Based on cancer test results, your doctor will assign a score or number to each letter. The higher the number, the larger the tumor or the more the cancer has spread. These scores will be combined to assign the cancer a stage. A TNM example might look like this: T2N1M0 or T2, N1, M0.

  * **T (tumor)** – Depth and spread of the main (primary) tumor(s) in one or both breasts
  * **N (node)** – If cancer has spread to nearby (regional) lymph nodes
  * **M (metastasis)** – If cancer has spread to distant parts of the body or metastasized

## Clinical staging

Clinical staging of lymph nodes is staging before surgery.

  * Cancer is in axillary nodes
  * Cancer is in internal mammary nodes
  * Cancer is in infraclavicular nodes
  * Cancer is in supraclavicular nodes

## T = Tumor

The primary tumor size can be measured in centimeters (cm) or millimeters (mm). One inch is equal to 2.54 cm. A large pea is 1 cm (10 mm). A golf ball is 4 cm (40 mm). A tumor micrometastasis is a very small collection of cancerous cells smaller than 1 mm. It might be written as T1mi. Ipsilateral means on the same side of the body.

  * **T1** – Tumor is 2 cm (20 mm) or less
  * **T2** – Tumor is 2.1 cm to 5 cm
  * **T3** – Tumor is more than 5 cm
  * **T4** – Tumor is of any size and has invaded nearby structures such as the chest wall and skin of the breast
  * **T4d** – Tumor is inflammatory carcinoma (inflammatory breast cancer)

## N = Regional lymph node

Lymph, a clear fluid containing cells that help fight infections and other diseases, drains through channels into lymphatic vessels. From here, lymph drains into lymph nodes. Lymph nodes work as filters to help fight infection.

Regional lymph nodes are those located near the breast in the armpit (axilla). If breast cancer spreads, it often goes first to nearby lymph nodes under the arm. It can also sometimes spread to lymph nodes near the collarbone or near the breastbone. However, it is possible for cancerous cells to travel through lymph and blood to other parts of the body without having gone to the lymph nodes first. Knowing if the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes helps doctors find the best way to treat your cancer.

  * **N0** means no cancer is in the regional lymph nodes. Isolated tumor cells (ITCs) may be present. These are malignant cell clusters no larger than 0.2 mm.
  * **N1mi** means micrometastases (approximately 200 cells, larger than 0.2 mm, but not larger than 2.0 mm) are found in lymph nodes.
  * **N1, N2, N3** means regional lymph node metastases are found. The higher the number, the more lymph nodes that have metastases.

## M = Metastasis

Cancer that has spread to distant parts of the body is shown as M1. This is metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The most common sites for metastasis are bone and lung.

  * **M0** means no evidence of distant metastasis.
  * **M1** means distant metastasis is found. This is metastatic breast cancer.

## Grade

Grade describes how abnormal the tumor cells look under a microscope (called histology). Higher-grade cancers tend to grow and spread faster than lower-grade cancers. GX means the grade can't be determined, followed by G1, G2, and G3. G3 is the highest grade for breast cancers. A low-grade tumor has a low risk of recurrence. A high-grade tumor has a higher risk of recurrence (of cancer returning).

  * **GX** – Grade cannot be determined
  * **G1** – Low
  * **G2** – Intermediate
  * **G3** – High

## Numbered stages

Numbered stages are based on TNM scores and receptor (hormone and HER2) status. Stages range from stage 0 to stage 4, with 4 being the most advanced. They might be written as stage 0, stage I, stage II, stage III, and stage IV.

  * **Stage 0 is noninvasive** - Noninvasive breast cancer is rated stage 0. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is found only in the ducts (Tis). It has not spread to the surrounding breast tissue, lymph nodes (N0), or distant sites (M0).
  * **Stages 1, 2, and 3 are invasive** - Invasive breast cancer is rated stage 1, 2, or 3. It has grown outside the ducts, lobules, or breast skin. Cancer might be in the axillary lymph nodes.
  * **Stage 4 is metastatic** – In stage 4 breast cancer, cancer has spread to distant sites. It can develop from earlier stages. Sometimes, the first diagnosis is stage 4 metastatic breast cancer (called de novo).

## Questions to ask

  * What is the cancer stage and tumor grade?
  * What does the cancer stage and grade mean in terms of treatment options and prognosis?
  * Is there more than one known cancer site?
  * Is cancer in the lymph nodes? If so, which lymph nodes?
  * What is the tumor HER2 and hormone status?

Anyone can develop breast cancer, including those assigned male at birth. Although there are some differences between breast cancers in those assigned male and those assigned female at birth, treatment is very similar for all genders.
