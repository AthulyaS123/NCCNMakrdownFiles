There is more than one treatment for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). This chapter describes treatment options and what to expect. Together, you and your care team will choose a treatment plan that is best for you.

# Care team

Treating breast cancer takes a team approach. Treatment decisions should involve a multidisciplinary team (MDT). An MDT is a team of health care and psychosocial care professionals from different professional backgrounds who have knowledge (expertise) and experience in your type of cancer. This team is united in the planning and implementing of your treatment. Ask who will coordinate your care.

Some members of your care team will be with you throughout cancer treatment, while others will only be there for parts of it. Get to know your care team and help them get to know you.

# Treatment overview

Surgery is an operation or procedure to remove cancer from the body. Surgery is the main or primary treatment for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). This is only one part of a treatment plan. When preparing for surgery, seek the opinion of an experienced surgeon. The surgeon should be an expert in performing your type of surgery. Hospitals that perform many surgeries often have better results. You can ask for a referral to a hospital or cancer center that has experience in treating your type of cancer.

## Goal of surgery

The goal of surgery or tumor resection is to remove all the cancer. To do so, the tumor is removed along with a rim of normal-looking tissue around its edge called the surgical margin. The surgical margin may look normal during surgery, but cancerous cells may be found when viewed under a microscope by a pathologist. A clear or negative margin (R0) is when no cancer cells are found in the tissue around the edge of the tumor. In a positive margin, cancer cells are found in normal-looking tissue around the tumor.

After surgery, you may receive treatment such as radiation to kill any remaining cancer cells. You might have a wound drain to prevent fluid from collecting in the body after surgery. These drains are usually removed a few days after surgery.

# Lumpectomy

Lumpectomy is the removal of abnormal cells or tumor. It does not remove the whole breast. A lumpectomy is also called breast-conserving therapy or breast-conserving surgery (BCS). In a lumpectomy, the surgeon aims to remove all DCIS with a rim of healthy tissue around it, called a negative, or clear, surgical margin. Having a negative surgical margin will decrease the chance that cancer may return in that area of the breast. You may need more than one surgery to achieve negative margins and ensure all the cancer was removed. A lumpectomy is usually followed by radiation therapy to part of or the whole breast. It is important to note that a lymph node biopsy is not done with a lumpectomy.

The breast might not look the same after a lumpectomy. Speak to your surgeon about how a lumpectomy might affect the look and shape of your breast, and any concerns you have. You can also seek the opinion of a plastic surgeon.

**Breast-conserving surgery**
The dotted line shows where the tumor is removed. Lumpectomy is the removal of abnormal cells or tumor and not the whole breast. It is also called a partial mastectomy, breast-conserving therapy, or breast-conserving surgery (BCS).

# Mastectomy

A mastectomy removes all of the breast. In some cases, the surgeon may do a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) before removing the breast. Sentinel lymph nodes are the first lymph nodes cancer cells are likely to have spread from the primary tumor.

Types of mastectomies include:

  * **A total mastectomy or simple mastectomy** removes the whole breast with a flat skin closure.
  * **A skin-sparing mastectomy** removes the breast but not all of the skin, in order to have breast reconstruction that might include flaps and/or implants.

> **Nipple-sparing mastectomy**
> preserves the nipple-areola complex (NAC) as well as all of the skin. Not everyone is a candidate for nipple-sparing mastectomy based upon location of cancer, breast size, and breast ptosis (degree of drooping).

Breast reconstruction is an option after a mastectomy. It might be done at the same time as mastectomy (immediate) or at some time following the completion of cancer treatment (delayed). Breast reconstruction is most commonly done in stages. If you are considering breast reconstruction surgery, it requires collaboration between a breast surgeon and a reconstructive (plastic) surgeon.

**Total (simple) mastectomy**
The dotted line shows where the entire breast is removed. Some lymph nodes under the arm may also be removed. Clinical staging of lymph nodes is staging before surgery.

# Sentinel lymph node biopsy

**For DCIS, this procedure is only done in some cases.**

A sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the first lymph node that cancer cells are most likely to spread to from a primary tumor. Sometimes, there can be more than one sentinel lymph node. Removal of the sentinel lymph nodes during surgery is called a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB or SNB). This procedure may be done during surgery such as a mastectomy (surgery to remove the breast) or lumpectomy (surgery to remove the tumor) to determine if any cancer cells have traveled to the lymph nodes. The lymph nodes removed are called the sentinel nodes. They may or may not contain any cancer cells. Just because these nodes are removed, it does not mean that they are positive for cancer.

To find the sentinel lymph nodes, a radioactive material and other dyes are injected into the area where breast tumor is located. From here, the dye travels through the lymphatics in the breast to the lymph nodes. This helps the surgeon find which of the nodes are the sentinel lymph nodes. Once the nodes are found, those containing the radioactive material or dye are removed and tested by a pathologist. If cancer is found, then more than the sentinel lymph nodes may be removed.

> **Standard of care** is the best-known way to treat a particular disease based on past clinical trials. There may be more than one treatment regimen that is considered standard of care. Ask your care team what treatment options are available and if a clinical trial might be right for you.

# Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy radiation from x-rays (photons), protons, and other sources to kill any remaining cancer cells after surgery. Different types of radiation can be used for DCIS. Most types include several short treatment sessions that are given once daily over a few days to weeks. Ask your care team which radiation option(s) are best for you and what side effects to expect.

Types of radiation therapy used in DCIS include:

  * **Whole breast radiation therapy (WBRT)** is used to treat the entire breast. Sometimes, additional treatments may be given to the tumor area. This is called a boost.
  * **Partial breast irradiation (PBI)** is used to treat only the tumor area of the breast. **Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI)** is radiation given over a shorter period of time.

## External beam radiation therapy

External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) uses a machine outside the body to aim radiation at the whole breast (WBRT) or only the tumor area of the breast (PBI).

## Internal radiation

Internal radiation (brachytherapy) involves placing one or more small tubes into the tumor area of the breast. A small radioactive seed travels into the tube(s) and delivers radiation to the tumor area of the breast from inside the body. This type of radiation is used only for PBI.

# Endocrine therapy

Endocrine therapy blocks estrogen or progesterone to treat hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. The endocrine system is made up of organs and tissues that produce hormones. Hormones are natural chemicals released into the bloodstream.

There are 4 hormones that might be targeted in endocrine therapy:

  * **Estrogen** is made mainly by the ovaries, but is also made by other tissues in the body such as fat tissue.
  * **Progesterone** is made mainly by the ovaries.
  * **Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH)** is made by a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. It tells the ovaries to make estrogen and progesterone and testicles to make testosterone. LHRH is also called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).
  * **Androgen** is made by the adrenal glands, testicles, and ovaries.

Hormones may cause breast cancer to grow. Endocrine therapy will stop your body from making hormones or it will block what hormones do in the body. This can slow tumor growth or shrink the tumor for a period of time.

Endocrine therapy is sometimes called hormone therapy or anti-estrogen. It is not the same as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) used for menopause.

Endocrine therapy will suppress the production of hormones and affect one's ability to become pregnant during treatment. Those who want to have children in the future should be referred to a fertility specialist before starting endocrine therapy.

Types of endocrine therapy can be found in **Guide 2**.

# Testosterone

For those assigned male at birth whose bodies continue to make testosterone, endocrine therapy includes tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor with a testosterone-suppressing therapy.

| Guide 2 Endocrine therapy types | |
|---|---|
|**Bilateral oophorectomy**|Surgery to remove both ovaries.|
|**Ovarian ablation**|Radiation to permanently stop the ovaries from making hormones.|
|**Ovarian or testosterone suppression**|Drugs to temporarily stop the ovaries or testicles from making hormones such as LHRH and GnRH.<br>- LHRH agonists include goserelin (Zoladex) and leuprolide (Lupron Depot). These are injected every 4 or 12 weeks. They do not affect estrogen made by the ovaries.<br>- GnRH agonists might be used to suppress ovarian hormone or testosterone production.|
|**Aromatase inhibitors (AIs)**|Drugs to stop a type of hormone called androgen from changing into estrogen by interfering with an enzyme called aromatase. They do not affect estrogen made by the ovaries. Nonsteroidal AIs include anastrozole (Arimidex) and letrozole (Femara). Exemestane (Aromasin) is a steroidal AI.|
|**Estrogen receptor (ER) modulators or anti-estrogens**|• Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) block estrogen from attaching to hormone receptors. Tamoxifen and toremifene (Fareston) are SERMs.<br>• Selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs) block and destroy estrogen receptors. Fulvestrant (Faslodex) and elacestrant (Orserdu) are SERDs.|
|**Hormones**|Hormone examples include ethinyl estradiol, fluoxymesterone, and megestrol acetate (Megace).|

# Premenopause

If you have menstrual periods, you are in premenopause. In premenopause, the ovaries are the main source of estrogen and progesterone.

> Tamoxifen is the endocrine treatment option for those in premenopause. Ovarian suppression or ablation is frequently considered for higher risk ER+ breast cancers.

# Menopause

In menopause, the ovaries permanently stop producing hormones and menstrual periods stop. Estrogen and progesterone levels are low, but the adrenal glands, liver, and body fat continue to make small amounts of estrogen. If you don't have periods, a test using a blood sample may be used to confirm your status.

Cancer treatment can cause a temporary menopause. If you stopped having periods due to removal of your uterus (hysterectomy) but you still have your ovaries, then you should have your menopausal status confirmed with a blood test. If both ovaries have been removed (with or without your uterus), you are in menopause.

> Tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor is the endocrine treatment for those in menopause. Aromatase inhibitors include anastrozole (Arimidex), exemestane (Aromasin), and letrozole (Femara).

## Preventing pregnancy during treatment

If you become pregnant during radiation therapy or endocrine therapy, it can cause birth defects. Non-hormonal birth control methods such as intrauterine devices (IUDs) and barrier methods are preferred in those with a breast cancer diagnosis. Types of barrier methods include condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, and the contraceptive sponge.

# Clinical trials

A clinical trial is a type of medical research study. After being developed and tested in a lab, potential new ways of treating cancer need to be studied in people. If found to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a drug, device, or treatment approach may be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider all of the treatment options available for their cancer type, including standard treatments and clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether a clinical trial may make sense for you.

## Phases

Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment and are done in phases.

  * **Phase 1** trials study the safety and side effects of an investigational drug or treatment approach.
  * **Phase 2** trials study how well the drug or approach works against a specific type of cancer.
  * **Phase 3** trials test the drug or approach against a standard treatment. If the results are good, it may be approved by the FDA.
  * **Phase 4** trials study the safety and benefit of an FDA-approved treatment.

## Who can enroll?

It depends on the clinical trial's rules, called eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age, cancer type and stage, treatment history, or general health. They ensure that participants are alike in specific ways and that the trial is as safe as possible for the participants.

## Informed consent

Clinical trials are managed by a research team. This group of experts will review the study with you in detail, including its purpose and the risks and benefits of joining. All of this information is also provided in an informed consent form. Read the form carefully and ask questions before signing it. Take time to discuss it with people you trust. Keep in mind that you can leave and seek treatment outside of the clinical trial at any time.

## Will I get a placebo?

Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines) are almost never used alone in cancer clinical trials. It is common to receive either a placebo with a standard treatment, or a new drug with a standard treatment. You will be informed, verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a clinical trial before you enroll.

## Are clinical trials free?

There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The study sponsor pays for research-related costs, including the study drug. But you may need to pay for other services, like transportation or childcare, due to extra appointments. During the trial, you will continue to receive standard cancer care. This care is often covered by insurance.

# Supportive care

Supportive care helps improve your quality of life during and after cancer treatment. The goal is to prevent or manage side effects and symptoms, like pain and cancer-related fatigue. It also addresses the mental, social, and spiritual concerns faced by those with cancer.

Supportive care is available to everyone with cancer and their families, not just those at the end of life. Palliative care is another name for supportive care.

Supportive care can also help with:

  * Making treatment decisions
  * Coordinating your care
  * Paying for care
  * Planning for advanced care and end of life

## Distress

Depression, anxiety, and sleeping issues are common and are a normal part of cancer diagnosis. Talk to your care team and with those whom you feel most comfortable about how you are feeling. There are services, people, and medicine that can help you. Support and counseling services are available.

## Fatigue

Fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to function due to lack of energy. Fatigue may be caused by cancer or it may be a side effect of treatment. Let your care team know how you are feeling and if fatigue is getting in the way of doing the things you enjoy. Eating a balanced diet, exercise, yoga, acupuncture, and massage therapy can help. You might be referred to a nutritionist or dietitian to help with fatigue.

## Loss of appetite

Sometimes side effects from surgery, cancer, or its treatment might cause you to feel not hungry or sick to your stomach (nauseated). You might have a sore mouth. Healthy eating is important during treatment. It includes eating a balanced diet, eating the right amount of food, and drinking enough fluids. A registered dietitian who is an expert in nutrition and food can help. Speak to your care team if you have trouble eating or maintaining weight.

## Lymphedema

Lymphedema is a condition in which lymph fluid builds up in tissues and causes swelling. It may be caused when part of the lymph system is damaged or blocked, such as during surgery to remove lymph nodes, or by radiation therapy. Cancers that block lymph vessels can also cause lymphedema. Swelling usually develops slowly over time. It may develop during treatment, or it may start years after treatment. If you have lymphedema, you may be referred to an expert in lymphedema management. The swelling may be reduced by exercise, massage, compression devices, and other means.

## Pain

Tell your care team about any pain or discomfort. You might meet with a palliative care specialist or with a pain specialist to manage pain.

## Palliative care

Palliative care is appropriate for anyone, regardless of age, cancer stage, or the need for other therapies. It focuses on physical, emotional, social, and spiritual needs that affect quality of life.

### Quality of life

Cancer and its treatment can affect your overall well-being or quality of life (QOL). For more information on quality of life, see *NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Palliative Care* at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.

> All cancer treatments can cause unwanted health issues called side effects. It is important to tell your care team about all of your side effects so they can be managed.

## Side effects

All cancer treatments can cause unwanted health issues called side effects. Side effects depend on many factors. These factors include the drug type and dose, length of treatment, and the person. Some side effects may just be unpleasant. Others may be harmful to one's health. Treatment can cause several side effects. Some are very serious. Tell your care team about any new or worsening symptoms.

## Survivorship

A person is a cancer survivor from the time of diagnosis until the end of life. After treatment, your health will be monitored for side effects of treatment and the return of cancer. This is part of your survivorship care plan. It is important to keep any follow-up care and imaging test appointments. Seek good routine medical care, including regular doctor visits for preventive care and cancer screening.

A personalized survivorship care plan will contain a summary of possible long-term effects of treatment called late effects and a list of follow-up tests. Find out how your primary care provider will coordinate with specialists for your follow-up care.

# Key points
