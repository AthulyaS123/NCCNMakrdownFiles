## Lumpectomy

A lumpectomy removes the area of DCIS and a margin of healthy tissue around it.  
This is also called breast-conserving surgery.  
- Local therapy focuses on the breast
and armpit (axilla) only. It includes surgery
and radiation therapy (RT).

- Systemic therapy works throughout
the body. It includes endocrine therapy.
Chemotherapy is not used to treat DCIS.

- Option 1:
  - Lumpectomy with whole breast radiation therapy (WBRT)
  - Lumpectomy with WBRT and radiation boost
- Option 2:
  - Lumpectomy with accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI)
  - partial breast irradiation (PBI)
- Option 3:
  - Lumpectomy only (not an option for most people)
- Option 4:
  - Total mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)
  - Flat closure or reconstruction after mastectomy

A lumpectomy is also known as breast-
conserving surgery (BCS). It may or may not
be followed by radiation therapy. Lymph node
surgery is not done with a lumpectomy. You
may have more than one surgery to ensure all
the cancer was removed.

A lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy is
an option for many but not all with DCIS. This
is not an option if you are pregnant, have some
health issues, or the cancer is throughout the
breast. The surgical margin must be cancer-
free, called a negative surgical margin (R0).
Lumpectomy options are described next.

Most of your breast will be treated with
radiation in whole breast radiation therapy
(WBRT). Whole breast radiation will help
to prevent the return of cancer. For every
cancer that returns there is an equal chance
of developing DCIS again or an invasive type
of cancer. Many factors are used to determine
risk of recurrence. Ask your care team if your
risk of cancer coming back is low or high. If it’s
high, you may receive extra radiation called a
boost.

When radiation therapy (RT) is given only to
the lumpectomy site, it is called partial breast
irradiation (PBI). This is an option in some
cases. You must have a low risk of the cancer
returning. Surgical margins must be cancer-
free. The size, grade, and other features of the
tumor will be considered. Accelerated partial
breast irradiation (APBI) therapy is radiation
given over a shorter length of time.

Treatment with a lumpectomy only (no
radiation) is an option for a small group of
people. You must have a low risk of the
cancer coming back. Surgical margins must
be cancer-free. The size, grade, and other
features of the tumor will be considered.

## Mastectomy

A total mastectomy or a simple mastectomy
is a surgery that removes the whole breast.
Chest muscle is not removed. A skin-sparing
mastectomy removes the breast but not all
of the skin. A nipple-sparing mastectomy
preserves the nipple-areola complex (NAC)
and the skin. Not everyone is a candidate for
nipple-sparing mastectomy. You might chooseto have closure or breast reconstruction
after a mastectomy.

- Cancer may be found at the surgical
margin.
- The tumor might be large, too big, or
Widespread.
- You may be at risk of developing a
second cancer.
- You might have a health issue.
- You may want a mastectomy.
- You may not be able to receive radiation
to the breast area.

A sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is done
at the time of mastectomy. Sentinel lymph
nodes are the first lymph nodes that cancer
cells are likely to have spread to from the
primary tumor. An SLNB finds and removes a
few of these nodes. The nodes are then tested
for cancer. Once the breast is removed, an
SLNB can’t be done. Instead, many lymph
nodes would have to be removed to test
for cancer. This is because a mastectomy
permanently changes lymph Àow and
drainage. Therefore, an SLNB will be done at
the time of a mastectomy just in case there is a
small area of invasive cancer in the breast.

Anyone can develop breast
cancer, including those
assigned male at birth.
Although there are some
differences between those
assigned male and those
assigned female at birth,
treatment is very similar for all
genders

## Endocrine therapy after lumpectomy

Endocrine therapy is often given after a
lumpectomy for cancers that are estrogen
receptor-positive (ER+). This is meant to
reduce the risk of cancer returning. For
treatment after breast-conserving surgery,

Consider endocrine therapy for 5 years for those with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) DCIS if
treated with:
- Breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy) and radiation therapy (RT)
- Lumpectomy alone
- Mastectomy on one side only

Endocrine therapy options:
For those in premenopause, tamoxifen
For those in menopause, tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor (AI)

Endocrine therapy includes treatments that
stop cancer growth caused by hormones. It is
sometimes called hormone therapy. It is not the
same as hormone replacement therapy (HRT).
- Breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy)
with radiation therapy (RT)
- Lumpectomy alone
- Mastectomy on one side only
There is more than one type of endocrine
therapy. The type prescribed by your care
team is partly based on if you have menstrual
periods.
- Those who have menstrual periods are in
premenopause. Tamoxifen is an option.
- Those whose menstrual periods have
stopped for more than 12 months are in
menopause. Tamoxifen or an aromatase
inhibitor (AI) is an option.
While taking endocrine therapy, it is important
to have follow-up visits with your care team
and seek regular preventive care with a
dentist. Let your dentist know if you are taking
any of these medicines. Let your care team
know about any planned dental procedures.
Medicine might be given to prevent bone loss
and fractures while on endocrine therapy. A
calcium and vitamin D supplement might be
recommended, but talk to your care team first.

## Follow-up care

After treatment, you will receive follow-up
care. It is important to keep any follow-up
visits and imaging test appointments. Contact
your doctor if you have any new or worsening
symptoms.


An update of your medical history and a
physical exam are part of follow-up care. Both
should be done every 6 to 12 months for 5
years, then once a year after 5 years of normal
results.

A mammogram should be done every 12
months after breast-conserving treatment. If
you had both breasts removed to reduce your
cancer risk, then mammograms aren’t needed.
The first mammogram might be as soon as 6

There are things you can do to lower your
chance of developing breast cancer in the
future. Changes in your lifestyle include eating
a mostly plant-based diet, exercising, limiting
alcohol, and quitting smoking. Your care team
can order information and support on how to
lower your risk.
