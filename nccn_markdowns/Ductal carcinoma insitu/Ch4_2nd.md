# Overview

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is treatable. Surgery is a central part of treatment for DCIS. Talk to your care team about what to expect from treatment. Your preferences about treatment are important. Make your wishes known. Treatment options are found in **Guide 3**.

There are 2 types of treatment:

  * **Local therapy** focuses on the breast and armpit (axilla) only. It includes surgery and radiation therapy (RT).
  * **Systemic therapy** works throughout the body. It includes endocrine therapy. Chemotherapy is not used to treat DCIS.

The goal of treatment is to prevent DCIS from growing outside the duct into surrounding tissue. When cancer spreads into the surrounding tissue, it is called invasive breast cancer. Invasive breast cancer is breast cancer that has spread from the milk ducts or milk glands (lobules) into the breast tissue or to nearby lymph nodes.

# Lumpectomy options

A lumpectomy is also known as breast-conserving surgery (BCS). It may or may not be followed by radiation therapy. Lymph node surgery is not done with a lumpectomy. You may have more than one surgery to ensure all the cancer was removed.

A lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy is an option for many but not all with DCIS. This is not an option if you are pregnant, have some health issues, or the cancer is throughout the breast. The surgical margin must be cancer-free, called a negative surgical margin (R0). Lumpectomy options are described next.

# Lumpectomy with whole breast radiation therapy

Most of your breast will be treated with radiation in whole breast radiation therapy (WBRT). Whole breast radiation will help to prevent the return of cancer. For every cancer that returns there is an equal chance of developing DCIS again or an invasive type of cancer. Many factors are used to determine risk of recurrence. Ask your care team if your risk of cancer coming back is low or high. If it's high, you may receive extra radiation called a boost.

# Lumpectomy with partial breast radiation therapy

When radiation therapy (RT) is given only to the lumpectomy site, it is called partial breast irradiation (PBI). This is an option in some cases. You must have a low risk of the cancer returning. Surgical margins must be cancer-free. The size, grade, and other features of the tumor will be considered. Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) therapy is radiation given over a shorter length of time.

# Lumpectomy only

Treatment with a lumpectomy only (no radiation) is an option for a small group of people. You must have a low risk of the cancer coming back. Surgical margins must be cancer-free. The size, grade, and other features of the tumor will be considered.

# Mastectomy option

A total mastectomy or a simple mastectomy is a surgery that removes the whole breast. Chest muscle is not removed. A skin-sparing mastectomy removes the breast but not all of the skin. A nipple-sparing mastectomy preserves the nipple-areola complex (NAC) and the skin. Not everyone is a candidate for nipple-sparing mastectomy. You might choose to have a flat closure or breast reconstruction after a mastectomy.

There are many reasons why a total mastectomy might be the best choice for you.

  * Cancer may be found at the surgical margin.
  * The tumor might be large, too big, or widespread.
  * You may be at risk of developing a second cancer.
  * You might have a health issue.
  * You may want a mastectomy.
  * You may not be able to receive radiation to the breast area.

# Total mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy

A sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is done at the time of mastectomy. Sentinel lymph nodes are the first lymph nodes that cancer cells are likely to have spread to from the primary tumor. An SLNB finds and removes a few of these nodes. The nodes are then tested for cancer. Once the breast is removed, an SLNB can't be done. Instead, many lymph nodes would have to be removed to test for cancer. This is because a mastectomy permanently changes lymph flow and drainage. Therefore, an SLNB will be done at the time of a mastectomy just in case there is a small area of invasive cancer in the breast.

Anyone can develop breast cancer, including those assigned male at birth. Although there are some differences between those assigned male and those assigned female at birth, treatment is very similar for all genders.

# Endocrine therapy after lumpectomy

Endocrine therapy is often given after a lumpectomy for cancers that are estrogen receptor-positive (ER+). This is meant to reduce the risk of cancer returning. For treatment after breast-conserving surgery, see **Guide 4**.

**Endocrine therapy**
Endocrine therapy includes treatments that stop cancer growth caused by hormones. It is sometimes called hormone therapy. It is not the same as hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

Endocrine therapy may be given to help reduce the risk of developing a second breast cancer in those who were treated with:

  * Breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy) with radiation therapy (RT)
  * Lumpectomy alone
  * Mastectomy on one side only

There is more than one type of endocrine therapy. The type prescribed by your care team is partly based on if you have menstrual periods.

  * Those who have menstrual periods are in premenopause. Tamoxifen is an option.
  * Those whose menstrual periods have stopped for more than 12 months are in menopause. Tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor (AI) is an option.

While taking endocrine therapy, it is important to have follow-up visits with your care team and seek regular preventive care with a dentist. Let your dentist know if you are taking any of these medicines. Let your care team know about any planned dental procedures.

Medicine might be given to prevent bone loss and fractures while on endocrine therapy. A calcium and vitamin D supplement might be recommended, but talk to your care team first.

### Treatment after breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy)

Consider endocrine therapy for 5 years for those with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) DCIS if treated with:

  * Breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy) and radiation therapy (RT)
  * Lumpectomy alone
  * Mastectomy on one side only

Endocrine therapy options:

  * For those in premenopause, tamoxifen
  * For those in menopause, tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor (Al)

# Follow-up care

After treatment, you will receive follow-up care. It is important to keep any follow-up visits and imaging test appointments. Contact your doctor if you have any new or worsening symptoms.

## Medical history and physical exam

An update of your medical history and a physical exam are part of follow-up care. Both should be done every 6 to 12 months for 5 years, then once a year after 5 years of normal results.

## Mammogram

A mammogram should be done every 12 months after breast-conserving treatment. If you had both breasts removed to reduce your cancer risk, then mammograms aren't needed. The first mammogram might be as soon as 6 months after completing radiation or breast-conserving treatment.

**Lowering your risk**
There are things you can do to lower your chance of developing breast cancer in the future. Changes in your lifestyle include eating a mostly plant-based diet, exercising, limiting alcohol, and quitting smoking. Your care team can offer information and support on how to lower your risk.
