# The breast after surgery
The look of your breast after surgery will depend on the type of surgery, the amount of tissue removed, and other factors such as your body type, age, and size and shape of the area before surgery. You might consider speaking with a plastic surgeon before surgery. This chapter offers more information on flat closure and breast reconstruction.

The recovery time for each procedure differs. This can affect your ability to return to work or participate in activities. You might consider speaking with a plastic surgeon before surgery to discuss your options and what to expect. A plastic surgeon performs oncoplastic (breast cancer surgery) reductions, balancing procedures, and breast reconstruction.

## Volume displacement
With a lumpectomy, most people have a scar with some volume loss. However, if you need a large lumpectomy and your surgeon thinks your breast will look more abnormal afterwards, your breast may be able to be re-shaped at the time of surgery. This procedure is called volume displacement or oncoplasty. Only a limited number of cancer centers perform this procedure. It is often done by the cancer surgeon or plastic surgeon right after the lumpectomy. The surgeon will shift the remaining breast tissue to fill the space left by the removed tumor.

If volume displacement is planned, a larger piece of your breast will need to be removed. Despite a larger piece being removed, the natural look of your breast will be kept. However, with large amounts of tissue removed, your breast may be smaller than before.

You may not like the results of the volume displacement. In this case, breast revision surgery may help. This surgery is done by a plastic surgeon. A second volume displacement may be an option, too. Another option is to get breast implants or mastectomy with reconstruction.

## Flat closure
In a total mastectomy with a flat closure, the entire breast, including nipple, extra skin, fat, and other tissue in the breast area, is removed. The remaining skin is tightened and sewn together. No breast mound is created, and no implant is added. The scar will be slightly raised and differ in color than the surrounding skin. A flat closure is not completely flat or smooth. The result varies from person to person. Ask to look at pictures from flat closures so you know what to expect.

## Breast reconstruction
Breast reconstruction is surgery to rebuild the shape and look of the breast after a mastectomy. In many cases, breast reconstruction involves a staged approach. It might require more than one procedure.

You may have a choice as to when breast reconstruction is done. Immediate reconstruction is finished within hours after removing the breast. Delayed reconstruction can occur months or years after the cancer surgery. Reconstruction can also be done in stages, with part of the reconstruction done at the time of the original cancer surgery and finished with another surgery later. A plastic surgeon performs breast reconstruction.

Breasts can be reconstructed with implants and flaps. All methods are generally safe, but as with any surgery, there are risks. Ask your treatment team for a complete list of side effects.

### Implants
Breast implants are small bags filled with salt water, silicone gel, or both. They are placed under the breast skin or muscle to look like a new breast following a mastectomy. A balloon-like device, called an expander, may be used first to stretch out tissue. It will be placed under your skin or muscle and enlarged every few weeks for 2 to 3 months. When your skin is stretched to the proper size, you will have surgery to place the final implant.

Implants have a small risk of leaking or causing other issues. You may feel pain from the implant or expander. Scar tissue or tissue death can occur.

### Flaps
Breasts can be remade using skin from other parts of your body, known as flaps. These flaps are taken from the abdomen, buttocks, thigh, or from under the shoulder blade. Some flaps are completely removed and then sewn in place. Other flaps stay attached to your body but are slid over and sewn into place.

There are several risks associated with flaps, including death of fat in the flap, which can cause lumps. A hernia may result from muscle weakness. Problems are more likely to occur among those who have diabetes or who smoke.

### Implants and flaps
Some breasts are reconstructed with both implants and flaps. This method may give the reconstructed breast more volume to match the other breast. For any reconstruction, you may need surgery on your remaining breast to match the size and shape of both breasts.

### Nipple replacement
Like your breast, a nipple can be remade. To rebuild a nipple, a plastic surgeon can use surrounding tissues. Also, nipples can be remade with tissue from the thigh or the other nipple. Tissue can be darkened with a tattoo to look more like a nipple. It is important to know that while you can remake something to look like a nipple, it will not have the sensation of your real nipple. Also, a tattoo can be done to look like a nipple without having to take tissue from another part of the body.

### What to consider
Some things to consider when deciding to have flat closure or reconstruction after mastectomy:
* **Your desire** - You may have a strong feeling towards flat closure or one form of reconstruction after being given the options. Breast reconstruction should be a shared decision between you and your care team. Make your wishes known.
* **Health issues** - You may have health issues such as diabetes or a blood disorder that might affect or delay healing, or make longer procedures unsafe.
* **Tobacco use** - Smoking delays wound healing and can cause mastectomy flap death (necrosis), nipple-areola complex (NAC) necrosis in a nipple-sparing mastectomy, infection, and failure of implant-based reconstruction. In free flap reconstruction, smoking increases the risk of complications. You are encouraged to stop smoking prior to reconstruction.
* **Breast size and shape** - There are limits to the available sizes of breast implants. Very large breasts or breasts that lack tone or droop (called ptosis) might be difficult to match. Breast reduction surgery might be an option.
* **Body mass index (BMI)** - Those with an elevated BMI have an increased risk of infections and complications with breast reconstruction.

**If you smoke or vape, seek help to quit**

Smoking or vaping nicotine greatly increases your chances of having side effects during and after surgery. Smoking and vaping can limit how well cancer treatment works and prevent wound healing. They also increase your chances of developing other cancers. Cannabis use might also affect the amount of anesthesia used during surgery.

Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that makes you want to keep smoking and vaping. Nicotine withdrawal is challenging for most people who smoke or vape. The stress of having cancer may make it even harder to quit. If you smoke or vape, ask your care team about counseling and medicines to help you quit.

## Key points
* Volume displacement is a shifting of the breast tissue to fill the space left by a lumpectomy.
* Flat closure is done after a mastectomy. The skin is tightened and sewn together without the addition of a breast implant.
* Breast reconstruction is surgery to rebuild the shape and look of the breast.
* Breasts that are fully removed in a mastectomy can be remade with breast implants, flaps, or both.
* Removed nipples can be remade with body tissue and/or tattooing.

## Questions to ask
* What will my breast look like after surgery?
* How many breast surgeries or breast reconstructive surgeries have you done?
* How long will it take for me to recover from surgery and what should I expect?
* How much pain will I be in and what will be done to manage my pain?
* What options are available if I do not like the look of my breast after surgery?
