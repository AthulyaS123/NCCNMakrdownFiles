# Testing for DCIS
Treatment planning starts with testing. This chapter presents an overview of the tests you might receive and what to expect.

Results from biopsy and imaging studies will be used to determine your treatment plan. For possible tests, see Guide 1.

### Guide 1: Possible tests

  * Medical history and physical exam
  * Diagnostic mammogram of both breasts
  * Biopsy with pathology review
  * Determine estrogen receptor (ER) status
  * Genetic counseling, if at risk for hereditary breast cancer
  * Breast MRI as needed

## General health tests

### Medical history

A medical history is a record of all health issues and treatments you have had in your life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury and when it happened. Bring a list of old and new medicines and any over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, herbals, or supplements you take. Some supplements interact with and affect medicines that your care team may prescribe.

Tell your care team about any symptoms you have. A medical history, sometimes called a health history, will help determine which treatment is best for you.

### Family history

Some cancers and other diseases can run in families. Your doctor will ask about the health history of family members who are blood relatives. This information is called a family history. Ask family members on both sides of your family about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they were diagnosed. It's important to know the specific type of cancer, or where the cancer started, and if it is in multiple locations, and if they had genetic testing.

### Physical exam

During a physical exam, your health care provider may:

  * Check your temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and breathing rate
  * Check your height and weight
  * Listen to your lungs and heart
  * Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat
  * Feel and apply pressure to parts of your body to see if organs are of normal size, are soft or hard, or cause pain when touched.
  * Examine your breasts to look for lumps, nipple discharge or bleeding, or skin changes.
  * Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your neck, underarm, and groin.

### Clinical breast exam

Clinical breast exam (CBE) is a physical exam of the bare breast performed by a health care provider to check for lumps or other changes. It is done while you are seated and/or lying down. Your provider should take time to palpate (feel) the entire breast, including the armpit. A nurse or assistant might also be in the room during the exam.

## Imaging tests

Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of your body. Imaging tests show the primary tumor, or where the cancer started, and look for cancer in other parts of the body. A radiologist, a medical expert in interpreting imaging tests, will interpret the test and send a report to your doctor.

### Diagnostic mammogram

A mammogram is a picture of the insides of your breast. The pictures are made using x-rays. A computer combines the x-rays to make detailed pictures. A bilateral mammogram includes pictures of both breasts. Mammogram results are used to plan treatment.

Diagnostic mammograms look at specific areas of your breasts, which may not be clearly seen on screening mammograms. Diagnostic mammograms include extra compression in certain areas of the breast, magnification views, or rolling the breast to image additional areas of the breast. Other tests may include a breast MRI.

### What's the difference between a screening and diagnostic mammogram?

A mammogram is a picture of the inside of your breast made using x-rays. During a mammogram, the breast is pressed between two plates while you stand in different positions. Multiple x-rays will be taken. A computer combines the x-rays to make detailed pictures.

**Screening mammograms** are done on a regular basis when there are no signs or symptoms of breast cancer. Results take a few days.

**Diagnostic mammograms** are used for those who have symptoms such as a lump, pain, nipple thickening or discharge, or whose breasts have changed shape or size.

**Diagnostic mammograms** are also used to take a closer look at an abnormal area found in a screening mammogram.

A radiologist will evaluate the **diagnostic mammogram** while you wait so if additional testing is needed, it can be done right away.

Both types of mammograms use low-dose x-rays to examine the breast. They may use either the standard 2-dimensional (2D) digital mammogram or 3-dimensional (3D) mammogram known as tomosynthesis.

### Breast MRI scan

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body. It does not use x-rays, which means there is no radiation delivered to your body during the test. Because of the very strong magnets used in the MRI machine, tell the technologist if you have any metal in your body. During the test, you will likely be asked to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as the technician collects the images.

For a breast MRI, a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA)—a rare, heavy metal—is used to enhance the quality of the MRI. There are no harmful effects from GBCA, but it may linger in the body for months to years afterward. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns.

A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where the magnet surrounds you. The space is small and enclosed. An open MRI has a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for an opening on each end. Closed MRIs are more common than open MRIs, so if you have claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed spaces), be sure to talk to your care team about it. MRI scans take longer to perform than CT scans.

#### Breast MRI

If needed, a breast MRI will be done in addition to a mammogram. In a breast MRI, you are positioned face down with your arms overhead.

## Biopsy

A biopsy is the removal of a sample of tissue from your body for testing. A pathologist will examine the biopsy for cancer and write a report called a pathology report. Ask questions about your biopsy results and what it means for your treatment.

There are different types of biopsies. Some biopsies are guided using imaging, such as mammogram. The primary or main tumor is biopsied first. Other tumors or tumors in different areas may also be biopsied. You may have tissue removed from the breast, lymph nodes, or both.

Types of possible biopsies include:

  * **Fine-needle aspiration (FNA)** or **core biopsy (CB)** uses needles of different sizes to remove a sample of tissue or fluid. In a **vacuum-assisted core biopsy (VACB)**, suction is used through a needle to remove the sample using a special vacuum device.
  * **Incisional biopsy** removes a small amount of tissue through a cut in the skin or body.
  * **Excisional biopsy** removes the entire abnormal area. This is not the preferred type of biopsy, but may be necessary if other methods are not possible or when the biopsy results don't match the expected findings. An excisional biopsy is usually done under anesthesia in an operating room.

Before biopsies are performed, usually the area is injected with numbing medicine. A core needle biopsy (CNB) removes more than one tissue sample, but usually through the same area on the breast. The samples are small. The needle is often guided into the tumor with imaging. When mammography is used during a biopsy, it is called a stereotactic needle biopsy.

One or more clips may be placed near the breast tumor during a biopsy. The clips are small, painless, and made of metal. They will mark the site for future treatment and imaging. The clips will stay in place until surgery. If the area biopsied is benign, the clip will remain in place to mark the biopsy site on future imaging. The clips cause no problems, even if they are left in place for a long time. You will be able to go through airport security and have an MRI.

### Biopsy results

Histology is the study of the anatomy (structure) of cells, tissues, and organs under a microscope. It is used to make treatment decisions. Your pathology report will contain information about histology. You may be recommended to have an open biopsy (surgery) to remove (excise) the tumor to confirm histology, such as invasive ductal carcinoma or invasive lobular carcinoma. Talk to your health care provider for more information on next steps.

## Estrogen receptor status

Estrogen is a hormone that plays a role in breast development. It is made by a gland in your body. A receptor is a protein found inside or on the surface of a cell. When substances such as hormones attach (bind) to these receptors, it causes changes within the cell. When hormones, such as estrogen, attach to receptors inside breast cancer cells, they can cause cancer to grow. If found, these estrogen receptors may be targeted using endocrine therapy.

### Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special staining process that involves adding a chemical marker to cells. These cells are then studied using a microscope. IHC can find estrogen receptors in breast cancer cells. A pathologist will measure how many cells have estrogen receptors and the number of estrogen receptors inside each cell. Test results will either be estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) or estrogen receptor-negative (ER-).

### Estrogen receptor-positive

In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, IHC finds estrogen hormone receptors in at least 1 out of every 100 cancer cells. ER+ cancer cells may need estrogen to grow. These cells may stop growing or die with endocrine treatment to block estrogen production or estrogen receptor signaling.

ER+ breast cancer is treated with endocrine therapy, which blocks estrogen receptor signaling or decreases estrogen production.

HER2 testing is not used in the diagnosis and treatment of DCIS.

### Estrogen receptor-negative

Estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast cancer cells do not have estrogen hormone receptors. These cancer cells do not need estrogen to grow and continue to grow. Therefore, estrogen-blocking treatment is not effective.

## Genetic cancer risk testing

About 1 out of 10 breast cancers are hereditary. Depending on your family history or other features of your cancer, your health care provider might refer you for hereditary genetic testing to learn more about your cancer. A genetic counselor or trained provider will speak with you about the results. Test results may be used to guide treatment planning.

Genetic testing is done using blood or saliva (spitting into a cup or a cheek swab). The goal is to look for gene mutations inherited from your biological (birth) parents called germline mutations. Some mutations can put you at risk for more than one type of cancer. You can pass these genes on to your children. Also, other family members might carry these mutations. Tell your care team if there is a family history of cancer.

### What is your family health history?

Some cancers and other diseases run in families—those who are related to you through genes passed down from biological (birth) parent to child. This information is called a family health history. Ask blood relatives about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they were diagnosed. For relatives who were diagnosed with cancer, ask them (or other relatives if they are no longer living) what type of cancer they had, if they died from the cancer, and at what age the cancer was diagnosed.

Start by asking your parents, siblings, and children. Next, talk to half-siblings, aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews, grandparents, and grandchildren.

Write down what you learn about your family history and share with your health care provider.

Some of the questions to ask include:

  * How old were you when each of these diseases and health conditions was diagnosed?
  * What is our family's ancestry—from what countries did our ancestors originate?

### BRCA tests

Everyone has *BRCA* genes. Normal *BRCA* genes help to prevent tumor growth. They help fix damaged cells and help cells grow normally. *BRCA* mutations put you at risk for more than one type of cancer. Mutations in *BRCA1* or *BRCA2* increase the risk of breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, pancreatic, and melanoma skin cancers. Mutated *BRCA* genes can also affect how some treatments work. These tests might be repeated.

### Other genes

Other genes such as *PALB2*, *p53*, *CHEK2*, and *ATM* might be tested. For example, *PALB2* normally helps prevent cancer. When *PALB2* mutates, it no longer works correctly. Those with a *PALB2* mutation have a higher risk of developing breast cancer.

## Breast cancer stages

A cancer stage is a way to describe the extent of the cancer at the time you are first diagnosed. Based on testing, your cancer will be assigned a stage. Staging helps to predict prognosis and is needed to make treatment decisions. A prognosis is the course your cancer will likely take.

Staging is based on a combination of information to reach a final numbered stage. It takes into account what can be felt during a physical exam, what can be seen on imaging tests, and what is found during a biopsy or surgery. Often, not all information is available at the initial evaluation. More information can be gathered as treatment begins.

Breast cancer staging is often done twice, before and after surgery.

  * **Clinical stage (c)** is the rating given before any treatment. It is based on a physical exam, biopsy, and imaging tests. An example might look like cT0 or cN1. Tests are done before any treatment as part of an initial diagnosis.
  * **Pathologic stage (p)** or surgical stage is determined by examining tissue removed during surgery. An example might be pT1.

### TNM scores

The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system is used to stage breast cancer. In this system, the letters T, N, and M describe different areas of cancer growth. Based on cancer test results, your doctor will assign a score or number to each letter. The higher the number, the larger the tumor or the more the cancer has spread. These scores will be combined to assign the cancer a stage. A TNM example might look like this: T1N0M0 or T1, N0, M0. For DCIS, it will look like this: TisN0M0.

  * **T (tumor)** – Depth and spread of the main (primary) tumor(s) in one or both breasts
  * **N (node)** – If cancer has spread to nearby (regional) lymph nodes
  * **M (metastasis)** – If cancer has spread to distant parts of the body or metastasized

### Lymph nodes

Lymphatic fluid, a clear fluid containing cells that help fight infections and other diseases, drains through channels into lymphatic vessels. From here, lymph drains into lymph nodes. Lymph nodes work as filters to help fight infection. Regional lymph nodes are found near the breast in the armpit (axilla). If breast cancer spreads, it often goes first to nearby lymph nodes under the arm. It can also sometimes spread to lymph nodes near the collarbone or near the breastbone. However, it is possible for cancerous cells to travel through lymph and blood to other parts of the body without having gone to the lymph nodes first. **DCIS does not typically spread to lymph nodes.**

### Grade

Grade describes how abnormal the tumor cells look under a microscope (called histology). Higher-grade cancers tend to grow and spread faster than lower-grade cancers. GX means the grade can't be determined, followed by G1, G2, and G3. G3 is the highest grade for breast cancers. A low-grade tumor has a low risk of recurrence. A high-grade tumor has a higher risk of recurrence (of cancer returning).

  * **GX** – Grade cannot be determined
  * **G1** – Low nuclear grade
  * **G2** – Intermediate nuclear grade
  * **G3** – High nuclear grade

### Numbered stages

Numbered stages are based on TNM scores and receptor (hormone and HER2) status. Stages range from stage 0 to stage 4, with 4 being the most advanced. They might be written as stage 0, stage I, stage II, stage III, and stage IV. Inflammatory breast cancer is stage 3 (invasive) or 4 (metastatic).

  * **Stage 0 is noninvasive** – Noninvasive breast cancer is rated stage 0. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is found only in the ducts (Tis). It has not spread to the surrounding breast tissue, lymph nodes (N0), or distant sites (M0).
  * **Stages 1, 2, and 3 are invasive but not metastatic** – Invasive breast cancer is rated stage 1, 2, or 3. It has grown outside the ducts, lobules, or breast skin. Cancer might be in the axillary lymph nodes.
  * **Stage 4 is metastatic** – In stage 4 breast cancer, cancer has spread to distant sites. It can develop from earlier stages. Sometimes, the first diagnosis is stage 4 metastatic breast cancer (called de novo).

## Key points

  * A diagnostic mammogram includes detailed pictures of one or both breasts. It is different than a screening mammogram.
  * During a biopsy, tissue or fluid samples are removed for testing. Samples are needed to confirm the presence of cancer and to perform cancer cell tests.
  * A sample from your biopsy will be tested for estrogen receptor (ER) status and grade (histology). This provides information about the behavior of your cancer, as well as treatments to which your cancer may respond. Other biomarker tests may be performed.
  * HER2 status testing is not done for DCIS.
  * DCIS does not typically spread to lymph nodes.
  * About 1 out of 10 breast cancers are hereditary. Depending on your family history or other features of your cancer, your health care provider might refer you for hereditary genetic testing or to speak with a genetic counselor.
