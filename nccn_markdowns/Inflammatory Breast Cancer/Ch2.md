# Testing for IBC
Treatment planning starts with testing. This chapter presents an overview of the tests you might receive and what to expect.

Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) can be difficult to diagnose. Often, there is no lump that can be felt during a breast exam or seen on a mammogram. Since there is swelling (edema) and redness (erythema) of the breast, IBC can look like an infection. A small skin biopsy of the affected breast area may help diagnose IBC. However, this doesn't replace a breast tissue biopsy. IBC is a clinical diagnosisâ€”a biopsy-proven breast cancer with inflammatory features. You can have IBC even if a skin biopsy does not find breast cancer in the lymphatics of the skin.

> For weeks my bra had been feeling uncomfortably tight. I tried to ignore it but then felt sharp, shooting pains and the skin looked 'funny.' It took multiple office visits and finally to a surgeon to learn I had inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). I'm a nurse and didn't know you could have breast cancer without a lump.



## General health tests

* Medical history and physical exam by multidisciplinary team. Medical photographs will also be taken.
* Diagnostic mammogram. Ultrasound (US) and breast MRI, as needed.
* Biopsy with pathology review
* Complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) including liver function tests (LFTs), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
* Determine tumor status including:
    * Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) hormone receptor (HR) status
    * HER2 status
* Address fertility, birth control, and sexual health concerns
* Genetic counseling and testing if at risk for hereditary breast cancer
* Imaging:
    * Chest CT. Contrast might be used.
    * CT or MRI of abdomen with or without pelvis. Contrast will be used.
    * Bone scan or FDG-PET/CT
    
### Medical history
A medical history is a record of all health issues and treatments you have had in your life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury and when it happened. Bring a list of old and new medicines and any over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, herbals, or supplements you take. Some supplements interact with and affect medicines that your care team may prescribe. Tell your care team about any symptoms you have. A medical history, sometimes called a health history, will help determine which treatment is best for you.

### Family history
Some cancers and other diseases can run in families. Your doctor will ask about the health history of family members who are blood relatives. This information is called a family history. Ask family members on both sides of your family about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they were diagnosed. It's important to know the specific type of cancer, or where the cancer started, and if it is in multiple locations, and if they had genetic testing.

### Physical exam
During a physical exam, your health care provider may:

* Check your temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and breathing rate
* Check your height and weight
* Listen to your lungs and heart
* Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat
* Feel and apply pressure to parts of your body to see if organs are of normal size, are soft or hard, or cause pain when touched
* Examine your breasts to look for clinical changes such as lumps, nipple discharge or bleeding, or skin changes
* Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your neck, underarm, and groin

### Clinical breast exam
Clinical breast exam (CBE) is a physical exam of the bare breast performed by a health care provider to check for lumps or other changes. It is done while you are seated and/or lying down. Your provider should take time to palpate (feel) the entire breast, including the armpit. A nurse or assistant might also be in the room during the exam.

### Distress screening
It is normal to have strong feelings about being diagnosed with cancer and your feelings can also change from day to day and week to week. Talk to your care team and those whom you feel most comfortable about how you are feeling. There are services, people, and medicine that can help you. Support and counseling are available. Dealing with a cancer diagnosis may sometimes be stressful and may cause distress. Your treatment team will screen your level of distress. This is part of your cancer care.

Distress is an unpleasant experience of a mental, physical, social, or spiritual nature. It can affect how you feel, think, and act. Distress might include feelings of sadness, fear, helplessness, worry, anger, and guilt. You may also experience depression, anxiety, and sleep issues.

### Performance status
Performance status (PS) is a person's general level of fitness and ability to perform daily tasks. Your state of general health might be rated using a PS scale called the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score or the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). PS is one factor taken into consideration when choosing a treatment plan.

## Fertility (all genders)
Some types of treatment such as chemotherapy can affect fertility, or the ability to have children. If you think you want children in the future, ask your care team how cancer and cancer treatment might change your fertility. To preserve your fertility, you may need to take action before starting cancer treatment. Those who want to have children in the future should be referred to a fertility specialist to discuss the options before starting treatment.

Fertility preservation is all about keeping your options open, whether you know you want to have children later in life or aren't sure at the moment. Fertility and reproductive specialists can help you sort through what may be best for your situation.

### Changes in fertility
Treatment might cause your fertility to be temporarily or permanently impaired or interrupted. This loss of fertility is related to your age at time of diagnosis, treatment type(s), treatment dose, and treatment length. Talk to your care team about your concerns and if you are planning a pregnancy.

### Preventing pregnancy during treatment
Preventing pregnancy during treatment is important. Cancer treatment can affect the ovaries, damage sperm, and hurt a developing baby. Therefore, becoming pregnant or having one's partner become pregnant during treatment should be avoided. Non-hormonal birth control methods such as intrauterine devices (IUDs) and barrier methods are preferred in those with a breast cancer diagnosis. Types of barrier methods include condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, and the contraceptive sponge. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding at the time of your cancer diagnosis, treatments will need to be avoided.

## Blood tests
Blood tests check for signs of disease and how well organs are working. They require a sample of your blood, which is removed through a needle placed into a vein in your arm. Some blood tests you might have are described next.

### Alkaline phosphatase
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme found in the blood. High levels of ALP can be a sign cancer has spread to the bone or liver. A bone scan might be performed if you have high levels of ALP.

### Complete blood count
A complete blood count (CBC) measures the levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in your blood. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body, white blood cells fight infection, and platelets control bleeding.

### Comprehensive metabolic panel
A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) measures substances in your blood. It provides important information about how well your kidneys and liver are working, among other things.

### Liver function tests
Liver function tests (LFTs) look at the health of your liver by measuring chemicals that are made or processed by the liver. Levels that are too high or low signal that the liver is not working well or that cancer has spread to the liver.

### Pregnancy test
Those who can become pregnant will be given a pregnancy test before treatment begins.

## Imaging tests
Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of your body. Imaging tests show the primary tumor, or where the cancer started, and look for cancer in other parts of the body. A radiologist, a medical expert in interpreting imaging tests, will interpret the test and send a report to your doctor.

The imaging tests described on the following pages are not in order of importance. You will not have all of these tests.

### Bone scan
A bone scan can assess if the cancer has spread to the bone. The bone scan uses a radiotracer. A radiotracer is a substance that releases small amounts of radiation. Before the pictures are taken, the tracer will be injected into your vein. It can take a few hours for the tracer to enter your bones. However, the test is quick and painless.

A special camera will take pictures of the tracer in your bones as it moves over your body. Areas of bone damage take up more radiotracer than healthy bone and show up as bright spots on the pictures. Bone damage can be caused by cancer, cancer treatment, previous injuries, or other health issues.

### Contrast material
Contrast material is a substance used to improve the quality of the pictures of the inside of the body. It is used to make the pictures clearer. Contrast might be taken by mouth (oral) or given through a vein (IV). Oral contrast does not get absorbed from your intestines and will be passed with your next bowel movements. IV contrast will leave the body in the urine immediately after the test. The types of contrast vary and are different for CT and MRI. Not all imaging tests require contrast, but many do.

Tell your care team if you have had allergic reactions to contrast in the past. This is important. You might be given medicines to avoid the effects of those allergies. Contrast might not be used if you have a serious allergy or if your kidneys aren't working well.

### What's the difference between a screening and diagnostic mammogram?
A mammogram is a picture of the inside of your breast made using x-rays. During a mammogram, the breast is pressed between 2 plates while you stand in different positions. Multiple x-rays will be taken. A computer combines the x-rays to make detailed pictures.

* **Screening mammograms** are done on a regular basis when there are no signs or symptoms of breast cancer. Results take a few days.
* **Diagnostic mammograms** are used for those who have symptoms such as a lump, pain, nipple thickening or discharge, or those whose breasts have changed shape or size. An ultrasound (US) is often used with a diagnostic mammogram.
* **Diagnostic mammograms** are also used to take a closer look at an abnormal area found in a screening mammogram.
* A radiologist will evaluate the **diagnostic mammogram** while you wait so if additional testing is needed, it can be done right away.
* Both types of mammograms use low-dose x-rays to examine the breast. They may use either the standard 2-dimensional (2D) digital mammography or 3-dimensional (3D) mammograms known as tomosynthesis.

### CT scan
A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan uses x-rays and computer technology to take pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many x-rays of the same body part from different angles. All the images are combined to make one detailed picture. Intravenous (IV) contrast is often used.

### Diagnostic mammogram
A mammogram is a picture of the insides of your breast. The pictures are made using x-rays. A computer combines the x-rays to make detailed pictures. A bilateral mammogram includes pictures of both breasts. Mammogram results are used to plan treatment.

Diagnostic mammograms look at specific areas of your breasts, which may not be clearly seen on screening mammograms. They are used to see tumor and the size of the tumor(s). Diagnostic mammograms include extra compression in certain areas of the breast, magnification views, or rolling the breast to image additional areas of the breast. Other tests may include a breast MRI or ultrasound.

### MRI scan
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body. It does not use x-rays, which means there is no radiation delivered to your body during the test. Because of the very strong magnets used in the MRI machine, tell the technologist if you have any metal or a pacemaker in your body. During the test, you will likely be asked to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as the technician collects the images. Contrast is often used.

A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where the magnet surrounds you. The space is small and enclosed. An open MRI has a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for an opening on each end. Closed MRIs are more common than open MRIs, so if you have claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed spaces), be sure to talk to your care team about it. MRI scans take longer to perform than CT scans.

* **A breast MRI** might be used in addition to a mammogram. You will be positioned face down in the machine with your arms above your head.
* **A spine or brain MRI** can be used to detect breast cancer that has spread (metastasized) to the spine or brain.

### PET scan
A PET (positron emission tomography) scan uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A tracer is a substance injected into a vein to see where cancer cells are in the body and how much sugar is being taken up by the cancer cells. This gives an idea about how fast the cancer cells are growing. Cancer cells show up as bright spots on PET scans. However, not all tumors will appear on a PET scan. Also, not all bright spots found on the PET scan are cancer. It is normal for the brain, heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright on PET. Inflammation or infection can also show up as a bright spot. When a PET scan is combined with CT, it is called a PET/CT scan.

> Inflammatory breast cancer can be difficult to diagnose. Ask for a referral to a breast specialist, if possible.

* An **FDG-PET/CT** uses a radiotracer called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). It is made of fluoride and a simple form of sugar called glucose. You cannot eat or drink for at least 4 hours before the scan. This scan is most helpful when other imaging results are unclear.
* A **sodium fluoride PET/CT** uses a radiotracer made of sodium fluoride.
* An **FES-PET/CT** uses FES, which is a radioactive form of the hormone estrogen. An FES-PET/CT might be used when cancer is estrogen receptor-positive (ER+).

### Ultrasound
An ultrasound (US) uses high-energy sound waves to form pictures of the inside of the body. This is similar to the sonogram used for pregnancy. A wand-like probe (transducer) will be held and moved on your bare breast using gel. It may also be placed below your armpit. Ultrasound is painless and does not use x-rays, so it can be repeated as needed. Ultrasound is good at showing small areas of cancer that are near the skin. Sometimes, a breast ultrasound or MRI is used to guide a biopsy.

## Biopsy
A biopsy is the removal of a sample of tissue from your body for testing. A pathologist will examine the biopsy for cancer and write a report called a pathology report. Ask questions about your biopsy results and what it means for your treatment.

There are different types of biopsies. Some biopsies are guided using imaging, such as ultrasound or MRI. The primary or main tumor is biopsied first. Other tumors or tumors in different areas may also be biopsied. You may have tissue removed from the breast, lymph nodes, or both.

Types of possible biopsies include:

* **Fine-needle aspiration (FNA)** or **core biopsy (CB)** uses needles of different sizes to remove a sample of tissue or fluid. In a **vacuum-assisted core biopsy (VACB)**, suction is used through a needle to remove the sample using a special vacuum device.
* **Excisional biopsy** removes the entire abnormal area. This is not the preferred type of biopsy, but may be necessary if other methods are not possible or when the biopsy results don't match the expected findings. An excisional biopsy is usually done under anesthesia in an operating room.
* **Skin biopsy** takes a small sample of inflamed skin on the breast.

Before biopsies are performed, usually the area is injected with numbing medicine. A core needle biopsy (CNB) removes more than one tissue sample, but usually through the same area on the breast. The samples are small. The needle is often guided into the tumor with imaging. When mammography is used during a biopsy, it is called a stereotactic needle biopsy.

One or more clips may be placed near the breast tumor during a biopsy. The clips are small, painless, and made of metal. They will mark the site for future treatment and imaging. The clips will stay in place until surgery. If the area biopsied is benign, the clip will remain in place to mark the biopsy site on future imaging. The clips cause no problems, even if they are left in place for a long time. You will be able to go through airport security and have an MRI.

### Axillary lymph node needle biopsy
An axillary lymph node (ALN) drains lymph fluid from the breast and nearby areas. In an axillary lymph node biopsy, a sample of lymph node near the armpit (axilla) is biopsied with a needle. This is to determine if abnormal lymph nodes seen on imaging tests contain cancer cells. An ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (US-FNA) or core biopsy will be used. If cancer is found, it is called node positive (node+). A marker may be placed in the node so that it can be identified later if needed.

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy
A sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the first lymph node that cancer cells are most likely to spread to from a primary tumor. Sometimes, there can be more than one sentinel lymph node. Removal of the sentinel lymph nodes during surgery is called a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB or SNB). This procedure is done during surgery such as a mastectomy (surgery to remove the breast) or lumpectomy (surgery to remove the tumor) to determine if any cancer cells have traveled to the lymph nodes. The lymph nodes removed are called the sentinel nodes. They may or may not contain any cancer cells. Just because these nodes are removed, it does not mean that they are positive for cancer.

To find the sentinel lymph node, a radioactive material and other dyes are injected into the area where breast tumor is located. From here, the dye travels through the lymphatics in the breast to the lymph nodes. This helps the surgeon find which of the nodes are the sentinel lymph nodes. Once the nodes are found, those containing the radioactive material or dye are removed and tested by a pathologist. If cancer is found, then more than the sentinel lymph nodes may be removed.

### Skin biopsy
A sample of inflamed skin on the breast will likely be removed to diagnose inflammatory breast cancer.

### Biopsy results
Histology is the study of the anatomy (structure) of cells, tissues, and organs under a microscope. It is used to make treatment decisions. Your pathology report will contain information about histology.

## HER2 status
Inflammatory breast cancers often produce greater than normal amounts of HER2. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a protein involved in normal cell growth. It is found on the surface of all cells. When amounts are high, it causes cells to grow and divide. Some breast cancers have too many HER2 genes or receptors. Too many HER2s is called HER2-positive (HER2+). You might hear it called HER2 overexpression or amplification.

There are 2 tests for HER2:

* **Immunohistochemistry (IHC)** measures receptors. If the IHC score is 3+, the cancer is HER2+. If the score is 0 or 1, it is considered HER2-negative (HER2-). If the score is 2+, further testing is needed.
* **In situ hybridization (ISH)** counts the number of copies of the *HER2* gene. This test is done mainly when the IHC score is unclear.

HER2 testing should be done on all new tumors. A tumor biopsy sample will be used. You might have more than one HER2 test.

### Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special staining process that involves adding a chemical marker to cancer or immune cells. The cells are then studied using a microscope. IHC can find estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors in breast cancer cells. A pathologist will measure how many cells have estrogen and/or progesterone receptors and the number of receptors inside each cell.

### FISH or ISH
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or other ISH methods like dual ISH are testing methods that involve special dyes called probes that attach to pieces of DNA, the genetic material in a person's cells.

## Hormone receptor status
Your blood carries hormones throughout your body. A hormone is a substance made by a gland in your body. A receptor is a protein found inside or on the surface of a cell. When substances such as hormones attach (bind) to these receptors, it causes changes within the cell. When hormones attach to receptors inside breast cancer cells, they can cause cancer to grow. If found, these receptors may be targeted using endocrine therapy.

There are 2 types of hormone receptors:

* **Estrogen** â€“ plays a role in ovary, uterus, and breast development
* **Progesterone** â€“ plays a role in menstrual cycle and pregnancy

Hormone receptor (HR) testing should be done on any new tumors. A biopsy sample will be used.

### Hormone receptor-positive
In hormone receptor-positive (HR+) or hormone-sensitive breast cancer, IHC finds estrogen receptors (ER+), progesterone hormone receptors (PR+), or both (ER+/PR+). Most breast cancers are ER+/PR+ or ER+/PR-.

> **Estrogen receptor (ER)** is stimulated by estrogen and provides survival and proliferation (rapid growth) signals. Cancer cells deprived of estrogen or that have their ER signal blocked with treatment may stop growing or die.
> **Progesterone receptor (PR)** binds progesterone and provides survival and proliferation signals. It is thought that PR expression also suggests the tumor is estrogen dependent. An ER-/PR+ tumor is relatively uncommon.

HR+ breast cancer is treated with endocrine therapy, which blocks estrogen receptor signaling or decreases estrogen production.

### Hormone receptor-negative
Hormone receptor-negative (HR-) breast cancer cells do not have estrogen or progesterone hormone receptors. These cancers are sometimes simply called hormone negative. HR- cancers often grow faster than HR+ cancers. Both the estrogen and progesterone receptors need to be negative for the cancer to be considered HR-.

## Biomarker testing
A sample from a biopsy of your tumor may be tested to look for specific DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) mutations/alterations, protein levels, or other molecular features. This information is used to choose the best treatment for you. It is sometimes called molecular testing or tumor profiling, tumor sequencing, gene expression profiling, or genomic testing.

### Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cells
* In ER+ breast cancer, testing finds estrogen hormone receptors in at least 1 out of every 100 cancer cells.
* In ER-low-positive invasive breast cancer, testing finds estrogen hormone receptors in 1 to 10 out of every 100 cancer cells.

Biomarker testing includes tests of genes or their products (proteins). It identifies the presence or absence of mutations and certain proteins that might suggest treatment. Proteins are written like this: BRCA. Genes are written with italics like this: *BRCA*. HER2 and hormone receptor status are part of biomarker testing. Your treatment team will recommend the best types of biomarker testing that are important for you.

Biomarker testing or mutation testing is more commonly done in metastatic breast cancer.

### Tumor mutation testing
A sample of your tumor or blood may be used to see if the cancer cells have any specific DNA mutations. This is a different type of DNA testing than the genetic testing for mutations you may have inherited from your birth parents. In tumor mutation testing, only the tumor is tested and not the rest of your body.

Testing is done using a variety of methods such as FISH, ISH, IHC, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These methods are used to identify the presence of gene mutations, alterations, rearrangements, or fusions.

* Certain mutations such as *PIK3CA*, *AKT1*, *PTEN*, *ESR1*, *NTRK*, and *RET* can be targeted with specific therapies. Testing for *ESR1* and *RET* mutations is done on hormone receptor-positive (HR+) tumors.

#### PD-L1 testing
Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is an immune protein. If this protein is expressed on the surface of cancer cells, it can cause your immune cells to ignore the cancer and suppress the anti-tumor immune response. If your cancer expresses PD-L1, you might have treatment that combines chemotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This is designed to activate your immune system to better fight off the cancer cells.

#### Tumor mutational burden
When there are 10 or more mutations per million base pairs of tumor DNA, it is called tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H). TMB-H can be used to help predict response to cancer treatment using immune checkpoint inhibitors that target the protein PD-L1.

#### MSI-H/dMMR mutation
Microsatellites are short, repeated strings of DNA. When errors or defects occur, they are fixed by mismatch repair (MMR) proteins. Some cancers have DNA mutations for changes that prevent these errors from being fixed. This is called microsatellite instability (MSI) or MMR deficiency (dMMR). When cancer cells have more than a normal number of microsatellites, it is called MSI-high (MSI-H). This is often due to dMMR genes.

#### Tumor markers
Your blood or biopsy tissue may be tested for proteins called tumor markers. Knowing this information can help plan treatment. Examples of some tumor markers in breast cancer include carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA 15-3, and CA 27.29. An increase in the level of certain tumor markers could mean that the cancer has grown or spread (progressed). However, not everyone has elevated levels of these markers and tumor markers alone are not a reliable method of detecting breast cancer. Therefore, they are not routinely checked and depend on your individual situation.

#### Liquid biopsy
Some abnormal changes (mutations) can be found by testing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood. In a liquid biopsy, a sample of blood is taken to look for cancer cells or for pieces of DNA from tumor cells. Sometimes, testing can quickly use up a tumor sample and a liquid biopsy might be an option in this case.

## Genetic cancer risk testing
About 1 out of 10 breast cancers are hereditary. Depending on your family history or other features of your cancer, your health care provider might refer you for hereditary genetic testing to learn more about your cancer. A genetic counselor or trained provider will speak with you about the results. Test results may be used to guide treatment planning.

Genetic testing is done using blood or saliva (spitting into a cup or a cheek swab). The goal is to look for gene mutations inherited from your biological (birth) parents called germline mutations. Some mutations can put you at risk for more than one type of cancer. You can pass these genes on to your children. Also, other family members might carry these mutations. Tell your care team if there is a family history of cancer.

> Testing takes time. It might take days or weeks before all test results come in.

### BRCA tests
Everyone has *BRCA* genes. Normal *BRCA* genes help to prevent tumor growth. They help fix damaged cells and help cells grow normally. *BRCA* mutations put you at risk for more than one type of cancer. Mutations in *BRCA1* or *BRCA2* increase the risk of breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, pancreatic, and melanoma skin cancers. Mutated *BRCA* genes can also affect how some treatments work. These tests might be repeated.

### Other genes
Other genes such as *PALB2*, *p53*, *CHEK2*, and *ATM* might be tested. For example, *PALB2* normally helps prevent cancer. When *PALB2* mutates, it no longer works correctly. Those with a *PALB2* mutation have a higher risk of developing breast cancer.

## Key points
* Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) can be difficult to diagnose. Often, there is no lump that can be felt during a breast exam or seen on a mammogram. Since there is swelling (edema) and redness (erythema) of the breast, IBC can look like an infection. Often, a biopsy of the affected skin is done to diagnose the tumor.
* Treatment can affect your fertility or the ability to have children. You might be referred to a fertility specialist to discuss fertility preservation.
* A diagnostic mammogram includes detailed pictures of both breasts. It is different than a screening mammogram.
* During a biopsy, tissue or fluid samples are removed for testing. Samples are needed to confirm the presence of cancer and to perform cancer cell tests.
* A sample from a biopsy of your tumor will be tested for estrogen receptor (ER) status, progesterone receptor (PR) status, HER2 status, and grade (histology). This provides information about the behavior of your cancer, as well as treatments to which your cancer may respond. Other biomarker tests may be performed. IBC can vary in its expression of these receptors and is not confined to one subtype of breast cancer.
* A sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the first lymph node(s) that cancer cells are most likely to spread to from a primary tumor. A sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNLB) might be done to look for cancer in your lymph node(s).
* About 1 out of 10 breast cancers are hereditary. Depending on your family history or other features of your cancer, your health care provider might refer you for hereditary genetic testing or to speak with a genetic counselor.
