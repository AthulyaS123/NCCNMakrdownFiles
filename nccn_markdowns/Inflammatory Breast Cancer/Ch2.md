# 2. Testing for IBC

---

## Testing for IBC

Treatment planning starts with testing. This chapter presents an overview of the tests you might receive and what to expect.  

Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) can be difficult to diagnose. Often, there is no lump that can be felt during a breast exam or seen on a mammogram. Since there is swelling (edema) and redness (erythema) of the breast, IBC can look like an infection. A small skin biopsy of the affected breast area may help diagnose IBC. However, this doesn’t replace a breast tissue biopsy. IBC is a clinical diagnosis—a biopsy-proven breast cancer with inflammatory features. You can have IBC even if a skin biopsy does not find breast cancer in the lymphatics of the skin.

> “For weeks my bra had been feeling uncomfortably tight. I tried to ignore it but then felt sharp, shooting pains and the skin looked ‘funny.’ It took multiple office visits and finally to a surgeon to learn I had inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). I’m a nurse and didn’t know you could have breast cancer without a lump.”

## General health tests

**Medical history**  
A medical history is a record of all health issues and treatments you have had in your life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury and when it happened. Bring a list of old and new medicines and any over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, herbals, or supplements you take. Some supplements interact with and affect medicines that your care team may prescribe. Tell your care team about any symptoms you have. A medical history, sometimes called a health history, will help determine which treatment is best for you.  

**Family history**  
Some cancers and other diseases can run in families. Your doctor will ask about the health history of family members who are blood relatives. This information is called a family history. Ask family members on both sides of your family about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they were diagnosed. It’s important to know the specific type of cancer, or where the cancer started, and if it is in multiple locations, and if they had genetic testing.  

**Physical exam**  
During a physical exam, your health care provider may:  
- Check your temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and breathing rate  
- Check your height and weight  
- Listen to your lungs and heart  
- Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat  
- Feel and apply pressure to parts of your body to see if organs are of normal size, are soft or hard, or cause pain when touched  
- Examine your breasts to look for clinical changes such as lumps, nipple discharge or bleeding, or skin changes  
- Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your neck, underarm, and groin  

**Clinical breast exam**  
Clinical breast exam (CBE) is a physical exam of the bare breast performed by a health care provider to check for lumps or other changes. It is done while you are seated and/or lying down. Your provider should take time to palpate (feel) the entire breast, including the armpit. A nurse or assistant might also be in the room during the exam.  

**Distress screening**  
It is normal to have strong feelings about being diagnosed with cancer and your feelings can also change from day to day and week to week. Talk to your care team and those whom you feel most comfortable about how you are feeling. There are services, people, and medicine that can help you. Support and counseling are available. Dealing with a cancer diagnosis may sometimes be stressful and may cause distress. Your treatment team will screen your level of distress. This is part of your cancer care.  

Distress is an unpleasant experience of a mental, physical, social, or spiritual nature. It can affect how you feel, think, and act. Distress might include feelings of sadness, fear, helplessness, worry, anger, and guilt. You may also experience depression, anxiety, and sleep issues. More information on distress can be found in the *NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Distress During Cancer Care* at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the *NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer* app.  

**Performance status**  
Performance status (PS) is a person’s general level of fitness and ability to perform daily tasks. Your state of general health might be rated using a PS scale called the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score or the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). PS is one factor taken into consideration when choosing a treatment plan.

## Fertility (all genders)

Some types of treatment such as chemotherapy can affect fertility, or the ability to have children. If you think you want children in the future, ask your care team how cancer and cancer treatment might change your fertility. To preserve your fertility, you may need to take action before starting cancer treatment. Those who want to have children in the future should be referred to a fertility specialist to discuss the options before starting treatment. Fertility preservation is all about keeping your options open, whether you know you want to have children later in life or aren’t sure at the moment. Fertility and reproductive specialists can help you sort through what may be best for your situation.  

More information on fertility preservation can be found at *NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer* at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the *NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer* app.  

**Changes in fertility**  
Treatment might cause your fertility to be temporarily or permanently impaired or interrupted. This loss of fertility is related to your age at time of diagnosis, treatment type(s), treatment dose, and treatment length. Talk to your care team about your concerns and if you are planning a pregnancy.  

**Preventing pregnancy during treatment**  
Preventing pregnancy during treatment is important. Cancer treatment can affect the ovaries, damage sperm, and hurt a developing baby. Therefore, becoming pregnant or having one’s partner become pregnant during treatment should be avoided. Non-hormonal birth control methods such as intrauterine devices (IUDs) and barrier methods are preferred in those with a breast cancer diagnosis. Types of barrier methods include condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, and the contraceptive sponge. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding at the time of your cancer diagnosis, treatments will need to be avoided.

## Blood tests

Blood tests check for signs of disease and how well organs are working. They require a sample of your blood, which is removed through a needle placed into a vein in your arm. Some blood tests you might have are described next.  

- **Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)** is an enzyme found in the blood. High levels of ALP can be a sign cancer has spread to the bone or liver. A bone scan might be performed if you have high levels of ALP.  
- **Complete blood count (CBC)** A complete blood count (CBC) measures the levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in your blood. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body, white blood cells fight infection, and platelets control bleeding.
- **Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)** measures substances in your blood. It provides important information about how well your kidneys and liver are working, among other things.  
- **Liver function tests (LFTs)** look at the health of your liver by measuring chemicals that are made or processed by the liver. Levels that are too high or low signal that the liver is not working well or that cancer has spread to the liver.  
- **Pregnancy test** Those who can become pregnant will be given a pregnancy test before treatment begins.

## Imaging tests

Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of your body. Imaging tests show the primary
tumor, or where the cancer started, and look for cancer in other parts of the body. A radiologist, a medical expert in interpreting imaging tests, will interpret the test and send a report to your doctor. The imaging tests described on the following pages are not in order of importance. You will not have all of these tests.

**Bone scan**
- A bone scan is used to find areas of bone damage or cancer spread. The bone scan uses a radiotracer. A radiotracer is a substance that releases small amounts of radiation. Before the pictures are taken, the tracer will be injected into your vein. It can take a few hours for the tracer to enter your bones. However, the test is quick and painless. A special camera will take pictures of the tracer in your bones as it moves over your body. Areas of bone damage take up more radiotracer than healthy bone and show up as bright spots on the pictures. Bone damage
can be caused by cancer, cancer treatment, previous injuries, or other health issues.
**Contrast material**
- Contrast material is a substance used to improve the quality of the pictures of the inside of the body. It is used to make the pictures clearer. Contrast might be taken by mouth (oral) or given through a vein (IV). Oral contrast does not get absorbed from your intestines and will be passed with your next bowel movements. IV contrast will leave the body in the urine immediately after the test. The types of contrast vary and are directed for CT and MRI. Not all imaging tests require contrast, but many do.

Tell your care team if you have had allergic reactions to contrast in the past. This is
important. You might be given medicines to avoid those allergies. Contrast
might not be used if you have a serious allergy or if your kidneys aren’t working well.


**CT scan (computed tomography)**
- A CT scan uses x-rays to make detailed pictures of areas inside the body. A contrast dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed.  

**Mammogram** 
- A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan uses x-rays and computer technology to take
pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many x-rays of the same body part from different
angles. All the images are combined to make one detailed picture. Intravenous (IV) contrast
is often used.

**What’s the difference between a screening and diagnostic mammogram?**
- A mammogram is a picture of the inside of your breast made using x-rays. During a
mammogram, the breast is pressed between 2 plates while you stand in different positions.
Multiple x-rays will be taken. A computer combines the x-rays to make detailed
pictures.
- Screening mammograms are done on a regular basis when there are no signs or symptoms of breast cancer. Results take a few days. Diagnostic mammograms are used for those who have symptoms such as a lump, pain, nipple thickening or discharge, or those whose breasts have changed shape or size. An ultrasound (US) is often used with a diagnostic mammogram. Diagnostic mammograms are also used to take a closer look at an abnormal area found in a screening mammogram. A radiologist will evaluate the diagnostic mammogram while you wait so if additional testing is needed, it can be done right away. Both types of mammograms use low-dose x-rays to examine the breast. They may use either the standard 2-dimensional (2D) digital mammography or 3-dimensional (3D) mammograms known as tomosynthesis.

**MRI scan (magnetic resonance imaging)**  
- A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan uses radio waves and powerful magnets
to take pictures of the inside of the body. It does not use x-rays, which means there is
no radiation delivered to your body during the test. Because of the very strong magnets
used in the MRI machine, tell the technologist if you have any metal or a pacemaker in your
body. During the test, you will likely be asked to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as the technician collects the images. Contrast is often used.

**PET scan (positron emission tomography)**  
- A PET (positron emission tomography) scan uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A tracer
is a substance injected into a vein to see where cancer cells are in the body and how
much sugar is being taken up by the cancer cells. This gives an idea about how fast the
cancer cells are growing. Cancer cells show up as bright spots on PET scans. However, not all
tumors will appear on a PET scan. Also, not all bright spots found on the PET scan are cancer.
It is normal for the brain, heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright on PET. Inflammation or
infection can also show up as a bright spot. When a PET scan is combined with CT, it is
called a PET/CT scan. An FDG-PET/CT uses a radiotracer called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). It is made of fluoride and a simple form of sugar called glucose. You cannot eat or drink for at least 4 hours before the scan. A sodium Áuoride PET/CT uses a radiotracer made of sodium fluoride. An FES-PET/CT uses FES, which is a radioactive form of the hormone estrogen.
An FES-PET/CT might be used when cancer is estrogen receptor-positive (ER+).

**Ultrasound (US)**  
- An ultrasound (US) uses high-energy sound waves to form pictures of the inside of the
body. This is similar to the sonogram used for pregnancy. A wand-like probe (transducer)
will be held and moved on your bare breast using gel. It may also be placed below your
armpit. Ultrasound is painless and does not use x-rays, so it can be repeated as needed.
Ultrasound is good at showing small areas of cancer that are near the skin. Sometimes, a
breast ultrasound or MRI is used to guide a biopsy.

## Biopsy

A biopsy is the removal of a sample of tissue from your body for testing. A pathologist will
examine the biopsy for cancer and write a report called a pathology report. Ask questions
about your biopsy results and what it means for your treatment. There are different types of biopsies. Some biopsies are guided using imaging, such as ultrasound or MRI. The primary or main tumor is biopsied. Other tumors or tumors in different areas may also be biopsied. You may have tissue removed from the breast, lymph nodes, or both.

**Types of biopsies include:**  
- Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy (CB) uses needles of different sizes to remove a sample of tissue or fluid. In a vacuum-assisted core biopsy (VACB), suction is used through a needle to remove the sample using a special vacuum device.
- Excisional biopsy removes the entire abnormal area. This is not the preferred type of biopsy, but may be necessary if other methods are not possible or when the biopsy results don’t match the expected findings. An excisional biopsy is usually done under anesthesia in an operating room.
- Skin biopsy takes a small sample of inflamed skin on the breast. A sample of inflamed skin on the breast will likely be removed to diagnose inflammatory breast cancer.

 
**Axillary lymph node biopsy**  
- An axillary lymph node biopsy removes lymph nodes from the armpit to check for cancer cells.  

**Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)**  
- A sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the first lymph node that cancer cells are most likely to spread
to form a primary tumor. Sometimes, there can be more than one sentinel lymph node.
Removal of the sentinel lymph nodes during surgery is called a sentinel lymph node biopsy
(SLNB or SNB). This procedure is done during surgery such as a mastectomy (surgery to
remove the breast) or lumpectomy (surgery to remove the tumor) to determine if any
cancer cells have traveled to the lymph nodes. The lymph nodes removed are called the
sentinel nodes. They may or may not contain any cancer cells. Just because these nodes
are removed, it does not mean that they are positive for cancer.
- To find the sentinel lymph node, a radioactive material and other dyes are injected into the
area where breast tumor is located. From here, the dye travels through the lymphatics in the breast to the lymph nodes. This helps the surgeon and which of the nodes are
the sentinel lymph nodes. Once the nodes are found, those containing the radioactive
material or dye are removed and tested by a pathologist. If cancer is found, then more than
the sentinel lymph nodes may be removed.

**Biopsy results**
- Histology is the study of the anatomy (structure) of cells, tissues, and organs under
a microscope. It is used to make treatment decisions. Your pathology report will contain
information about histology.

## HER2 status

Inflammatory breast cancers often produce greater than normal amounts of HER2. Human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a protein involved in normal cell growth.
It is found on the surface of all cells. When amounts are high, it causes cells to grow and
divide. Some breast cancers have too many HER2 genes or receptors. Too many HER2s is
called HER2-positive (HER2+). You might hear it called HER2 overexpression or amplification.
There are 2 tests for HER2: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) measures receptors. If the IHC score is 3+, the cancer is HER2+. If the score is 0 or 1, it is considered HER2-negative (HER2-). If the score is 2+, further testing is needed. In situ hybridization (ISH) counts the number of copies of the HER2 gene. This test is done mainly when the IHC score is unclear.

**Immunohistochemistry**: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special staining process that involves adding a chemical marker to cancer or immune cells. The cells are then studied using a microscope. IHC can estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors in breast cancer cells. A
pathologist will measure how many cells have estrogen and/or progesterone receptors and
the number of receptors inside each cell.

**FISH or ISH**: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or other ISH methods like dual ISH are testing methods that involve special dyes called probes that attach to pieces of DNA, the
genetic material in a person’s cells.

## Hormone receptor status

Your blood carries hormones throughout your body. A hormone is a substance made by a
gland in your body. A receptor is a protein found inside or on the surface of a cell. When
substances such as hormones attach (bind) to these receptors, it causes changes within
the cell. When hormones attach to receptors inside breast cancer cells, they can cause
cancer to grow. If found, these receptors may be targeted using endocrine therapy.Estrogen – plays a role in ovary, uterus, and breast development. Progesterone – plays a role in
menstrual cycle and pregnancy.

In **hormone receptor-positive (HR+)** or **hormone-sensitive breast cancer**, IHC
estrogen receptors (ER+), progesterone hormone receptors (PR+), or both (ER+/
PR+). Most breast cancers are ER+/PR+ or ER+/PR-.

**Hormone receptor-negative (HR-)** breast cancer cells do not have estrogen or
progesterone hormone receptors. These cancers are sometimes simply called hormone
negative. HR- cancers often grow faster than HR+ cancers. Both the estrogen and
progesterone receptors need to be negative for the cancer to be considered HR-.

---

## Biomarker testing

A sample from a biopsy of your tumor may be tested to look for specific DNA
(deoxyribonucleic acid) mutations/alterations, protein levels, or other molecular features.
This information is used to choose the best treatment for you. It is sometimes called
molecular testing or tumor, tumor sequencing, gene expression pooling, or
Genomic testing.

In **ER+ breast cancer**, testing estrogen hormone receptors in at least 1 out of every 100 cancer cells. In ER-low–positive invasive breast cancer, testing estrogen hormone receptors in 1 to 10 out of every 100 cancer cells.

Biomarker testing includes tests of genes or their products (proteins). It identifies
the presence or absence of mutations and certain proteins that might suggest treatment.
Proteins are written like this: BRCA. Genes are written with italics like this: BRCA. HER2 and
hormone receptor status are part of biomarker testing. Your treatment team will recommend
the best types of biomarker testing that are important for you.

**Tumor mutation testing**
- A sample of your tumor or blood may be used to see if the cancer cells have any specific
DNA mutations. This is a different type of DNA testing than the genetic testing for mutations
you may have inherited from your birth parents. In tumor mutation testing, only the tumor is tested and not the rest of your body. Certain mutations such as PIK3CA, AKT1, PTEN, ESR1, NTRK, and RET can be targeted with specific therapies. Testing
for ESR1 and RET mutations is done on hormone receptor-positive (HR+) tumors.

**PD-L1 testing**
- Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is an
immune protein. If this protein is expressed
on the surface of cancer cells, it can cause
your immune cells to ignore the cancer and
suppress the anti-tumor immune response. If
your cancer expresses PD-L1, you might have
treatment that combines chemotherapy and a
checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This is designed to
activate your immune system to better fight off
the cancer cells.

**Tumor mutational burden**
- When there are 10 or more mutations per
million base pairs of tumor DNA, it is called
tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H). TMB-H
can be used to help predict response to cancer
treatment using immune checkpoint inhibitors
that target the protein PD-L1.

**MSI-H/dMMR mutation**
- Microsatellites are short, repeated strings of
DNA. When errors or defects occur, they are
used by mismatch repair (MMR) proteins.
Some cancers have DNA mutations for
changes that prevent these errors from being
used. This is called microsatellite instability
(MSI) or MMR deficiency (dMMR). When
cancer cells have more than a normal number
of microsatellites, it is called MSI-high (MSI-H).
This is often due to dMMR genes.

**Tumor markers**
- Your blood or biopsy tissue may be tested for
proteins called tumor markers. Knowing this
information can help plan treatment. Examples
of some tumor markers in breast cancer
include carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA
15-3, and CA 27.29. An increase in the level
of certain tumor markers could mean that the
cancer has grown or spread (progressed).
However, not everyone has elevated levels
of these markers and tumor markers alone
are not a reliable method of detecting breast
cancer. Therefore, they are not routinely
checked and depend on your individual
situation.

**Liquid biopsy**
- Some abnormal changes (mutations) can be
found by testing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)
in the blood. In a liquid biopsy, a sample of
blood is taken to look for cancer cells or for
pieces of DNA from tumor cells. Sometimes,
testing can quickly use up a tumor sample and
a liquid biopsy might be an option in this case.

## Genetic cancer risk testing

About 1 out of 10 breast cancers are
hereditary. Depending on your family history or
other features of your cancer, your health care
provider might refer you for hereditary genetic
testing to learn more about your cancer. A
genetic counselor or trained provider will speak
with you about the results. Test results may be
used to guide treatment planning.

Genetic testing is done using blood or saliva
(spitting into a cup or a cheek swab). The goal
is to look for gene mutations inherited from
your biological (birth) parents called germline
mutations. Some mutations can put you at
risk for more than one type of cancer. You
can pass these genes on to your children.
Also, other family members might carry these
mutations. Tell your care team if there is a
family history of cancer.

**BRCA tests**
- Everyone has BRCA genes. Normal BRCA
genes help to prevent tumor growth. They help
damaged cells and help cells grow normally.
BRCA mutations put you at risk for more than
one type of cancer. Mutations in BRCA1 or
BRCA2 increase the risk of breast, ovarian,
prostate, colorectal, pancreatic, and melanoma
skin cancers. Mutated BRCA genes can also
affect how some treatments work. These tests
might be repeated.

**Other genes**
- Other genes such as PALB2, p53, CHEK2,
and ATM might be tested. For example, PALB2
normally helps prevent cancer. When PALB2
mutates, it no longer works correctly. Those
with a PALB2 mutation have a higher risk of
developing breast cancer.
