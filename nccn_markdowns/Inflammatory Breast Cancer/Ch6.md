# How is IBC treated?

Since inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) spreads quickly, treatment starts with systemic (drug) therapy to stop the spread of cancer. Together, you and your care team will choose a treatment plan that is best for you.

IBC is treated with systemic therapy to shrink the tumor, followed by surgery to remove the breast and lymph nodes (modified radical mastectomy), and then radiation therapy to the chest wall. Surgery is not always possible. Even though surgery might not be an option, systemic therapy will continue.

If you choose breast reconstruction after a mastectomy with radiation, then delayed breast reconstruction is recommended. Radiation can slow the healing process. Therefore, it is better to wait until you have healed from radiation therapy before having breast reconstruction.

Like other breast cancers, IBC can develop in those assigned male at birth.

> "My 3-month-old son stopped nursing on my left breast and it was swollen and painful. The doctor said it was mastitis, but this didn't feel the same as when I'd had that before. Even with the antibiotic, it didn't improve. An ultrasound showed a questionable area in that breast and a biopsy confirmed inflammatory breast cancer (IBC)."

### Where does treatment start?

Treatment for IBC starts with preoperative systemic (drug) therapy. Preoperative therapy is treatment given before surgery. It is based on HER2 and hormone receptor (HR) expression status of the tumor cells.

Cancer can still progress during preoperative systemic therapy. If cancer progresses, then another systemic (drug) therapy will be given.

Treatment before surgery is described next.

## HER2-

In HER2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer, tumor cells do not express increased levels of HER2. Chemotherapy is used to treat HER- cancer. It might include another systemic therapy. Systemic therapy options for HER2- can be found in **Guide 4**.

### Triple-negative breast cancer

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the tumor tested negative for HER2, estrogen receptors, and progesterone receptors. It is written as ER- and/or PR- with HER2-. This cancer is treated with chemotherapy and other systemic therapies found in **Guide 4**.

| **Notes** | Other taxanes (ie, docetaxel, paclitaxel, albumin-bound paclitaxel) might be substituted in some cases |

## HER2+

Inflammatory breast cancers often produce greater than normal amounts of HER2. If the tumor is HER2-positive (HER2+), then it is treated with HER2-targeted therapy found in **Guide 5**.

**Triple-positive breast cancer**

In triple-positive breast cancer, tumor cells have estrogen receptors (ER+), progesterone receptors (PR+), and a larger than normal number of HER2 receptors on their surface. It is treated with HER2-targeted therapy and endocrine therapy. A CDK4/6 inhibitor may be added. See **Guide 5**.

| Guide 5 | HER2-targeted therapy options: HER2+ cancer |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Preferred** | \<ul\>\<li\>Paclitaxel and trastuzumab\</li\>\<li\>Docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab (TCH)\</li\>\<li\>Docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab (TCHP)\</li\>\</ul\>If no residual disease after preoperative therapy or no preoperative therapy:\<ul\>\<li\>Complete up to 1 year of HER2-targeted therapy with trastuzumab.

| **Notes** | Other taxanes (ie, docetaxel, paclitaxel, albumin-bound paclitaxel) might be substituted in some cases |

## Treatment response

The next treatment is based on how the tumor responded to preoperative systemic therapy. It is called preoperative (before surgery) treatment because the goal is surgery, when possible. Systemic therapy given after surgery is called adjuvant therapy. Adjuvant systemic therapy may be given after surgery to reduce the chance of cancer recurrence.

A physical exam and imaging tests should be done to assess how the cancer responded to preoperative systemic therapy. Treatment will be based on if the tumor can be removed with surgery or if the tumor did not shrink enough to be removed with surgery.

### Surgery is an option

If surgery is possible, then a total mastectomy with level I and II axillary lymph node dissection is the recommended option. Because IBC usually involves a large portion of the breast, lumpectomy is not typically an option. You may choose a delayed breast reconstruction as part of the mastectomy. Radiation therapy (RT) is part of this treatment.

After the mastectomy you will finish chemotherapy if you didn't complete the course before surgery and have radiation therapy. Tumors that are estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), progesterone receptor-positive (PR+), or both (ER+/PR+) are treated with endocrine therapy.

If the tumor is HER2+, then you will complete up to one year of HER2-targeted therapy. This may be given with RT and endocrine therapy.

> For a list of systemic therapies that target HER2+, **see Guide 5.**
> For a list of endocrine therapy options, **see Guide 6.**

### Surgery is not an option

Surgery is not always possible. Even though surgery might not be an option, systemic therapy will continue. If the cancer is not responding to systemic therapy, then radiation may be considered to try to make the cancer resectable (able to be removed with surgery). The goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of cancer. Talk with your care team about your goals of treatment and your treatment preferences. Your wishes are always important.

## Follow-up care

After treatment, you will receive follow-up care. During this time, your health will be monitored for side effects of treatment (late effects) and the possible return of cancer (recurrence). It is important to keep any follow-up care and imaging test appointments. Seek routine medical care, including regular doctor visits for preventive care and cancer screening. Find out who will coordinate with specialists for your follow-up care.

Tell your care team about any symptoms such as headaches, menstrual spotting between periods or new onset of spotting after menopause (if prior tamoxifen use), shortness of breath while walking, or bone pain. Side effects can be managed. Continue to take all medicine such as endocrine therapy exactly as prescribed and do not miss or skip doses.

Follow-up care can be found in **Guide 7**.

**Guide 7: Follow-up care**

  * Medical history and physical exam 1 to 4 times per year as needed for 5 years, then every year
  * Screen for distress, anxiety, depression, and changes in family history
  * Genetic testing and referral to genetic counseling, as needed
  * Monitor for lymphedema and refer for lymphedema management, as needed
  * Mammogram every 12 months (not needed for the side that underwent a mastectomy or on reconstructed breast)
  * Discuss any issues or questions related to fertility, birth control, or sexual health
  * Heart tests, as needed
  * Information on risk of future health issues (comorbidities)
  * If signs and symptoms of metastases, then blood and imaging tests
  * If taking endocrine therapy, continue to take endocrine therapy. Do not miss or skip doses
  * Annual gynecology exam (depending on age)
  * Bone density tests for those on an aromatase inhibitor or who later have ovarian issues
  * Maintain an ideal body weight (BMI of 20 to 25), be active, eat a mostly plant-based diet, exercise, limit alcohol, and quit smoking/vaping nicotine

## Key points

  * Treatment for inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) starts with preoperative systemic therapy. Preoperative therapy is treatment given before surgery. It is based on hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 expression status of the tumor cells.
  * Treatment after surgery is called adjuvant treatment. It often includes systemic therapy and radiation therapy (RT). It is given to kill any remaining cancer cells and to help prevent the return of cancer.
  * Adjuvant treatment is based on the stage, histology, and hormone receptor (HR) status. Histology is the study of the anatomy (structure) of cells, tissues, and organs under a microscope.
  * Inflammatory breast cancers often produce greater than normal amounts of HER2. If the tumor is HER2+, then HER2-targeted therapy is given.

> In hormone receptor HR-positive (HR+) cancer, tumor cells test positive for estrogen receptors (ER+), progesterone receptors (PR+), or both (ER+/PR+). Endocrine therapy is used to treat HR+ cancer.

> If chemotherapy is given, it is given before radiation therapy and endocrine therapy.

> It is important to keep follow-up visits and imaging test appointments. Seek good routine medical care, including preventive care and cancer screenings. Continue to take all medicines as prescribed.

## Questions to ask

  * What treatments do you recommend and why?
  * Does the order of treatments matter?
  * Which option is proven to work best for my type of cancer, age, overall health, and other factors?
  * Are there resources to help me pay for treatment or other care I may need?
  * Am I a candidate for a clinical trial?
