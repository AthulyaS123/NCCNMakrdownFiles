# What is inflammatory breast cancer?

Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a type of invasive breast cancer. Most inflammatory breast cancers are invasive ductal carcinomasâ€”cancer that starts in the cells that line the milk ducts and spreads into surrounding tissue. What makes IBC different from other breast cancers is its tendency to invade the drainage channels (lymphatics) of the breast and overlying skin. This causes the breast to rapidly swell with backed up fluid and turn red as if inflamed.

Possible signs of IBC:

  * Peau d'orange (pitted or dimpled appearance of skin)
  * Skin thickening (skin has an orange-peel texture)
  * Edema (swelling caused by excess fluid in body tissue)
  * Erythema (reddening of the skin, usually in patches)

**Inflammatory breast cancer**
In inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin of the breast. This causes the breast to look red and swollen and feel warm to the touch.

It's important not to dismiss any strange breast skin changes, including redness, swelling, or feeling warm to the touch. These changes could be an infection, but it's important to get medical attention right away.

Like other breast cancers, IBC can happen in those assigned male at birth. Although there are some differences between those assigned male and those assigned female at birth, treatment is very similar for all genders.

# What are the parts of the breast?

The breast is a gland on the chest. The breast is made of milk ducts, fat, nerves, lymph and blood vessels, ligaments, and other connective tissue. Behind the breast is the pectoral (chest) muscle and ribs. Muscles and ligaments help hold the breast in place.

Breast tissue contains glands that can make milk. These milk glands are called lobules. Lobules look like tiny clusters of grapes. Small tubes called ducts connect the lobules to the nipple.

The ring of darker breast skin is called the areola. The raised tip within the areola is called the nipple. The nipple-areola complex (NAC) is a term that refers to both parts.

Lymph drains from breast tissue into lymph vessels and travels to lymph nodes near your armpit (axilla). Lymph is a clear fluid that gives cells water and food. It also helps to fight germs. Nodes near the armpit are called axillary lymph nodes (ALNs). Cancer cells can travel though lymph and lymph vessels to lymph nodes.

## Invasive ductal carcinoma

Most inflammatory breast cancers (IBCs) are invasive ductal carcinomas. This means that cancer started in the cells that line the milk ducts and has spread into surrounding tissue.

# Why you should read this book

Making decisions about cancer care can be stressful. You may need to make tough decisions under pressure about complex choices.

The NCCN Guidelines for Patients are trusted by patients and providers. They clearly explain current care recommendations made by respected experts in the field. Recommendations are based on the latest research and practices at leading cancer centers.

Cancer care is not the same for everyone. By following expert recommendations for your situation, you are more likely to improve your care and have better outcomes as a result. Use this book as your guide to find the information you need to make important decisions.

# What can you do to get the best care?

Advocate for yourself. You have an important role to play in your care. In fact, you're more likely to get the care you want by asking questions and making shared decisions with your care team. Find an oncologist who is willing to spend time answering all your questions. The better you understand the disease and your treatment options, the more informed decisions you can make. Consider seeking the opinion of a breast cancer specialist.

The NCCN Guidelines for Patients will help you understand cancer care. With better understanding, you'll be more prepared to discuss your care with your team and share your concerns. Many people feel more satisfied when they play an active role in their care.

You may not know what to ask your care team. That's common. Each chapter in this book ends with an important section called *Questions to ask*. These suggested questions will help you get more information on all aspects of your care.

Take the next step and keep reading to learn what is the best care for you\!
