# Types of treatment

## Care team

Treating breast cancer takes a team approach. Treatment decisions should involve a multidisciplinary team (MDT). An MDT is a team of health care and psychosocial care professionals from different professional backgrounds who have knowledge (expertise) and experience in your type of cancer. This team is united in the planning and implementing of your treatment. Ask who will coordinate your care.

Some members of your care team will be with you throughout cancer treatment, while others will only be there for parts of it. Get to know your care team and help them get to know you.

## Treatment overview

Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is treatable. Treatment can be local, systemic, or usually a combination of both.

**Local therapy** focuses on the breast, chest wall, and lymph node area. It includes:

  * Surgery (mastectomy and lymph node surgery)
  * Radiation therapy (RT)

**Systemic therapy** works throughout the body. It includes:

  * Chemotherapy
  * HER2-targeted therapy
  * Inhibitors and other targeted therapies
  * Immunotherapy
  * Endocrine therapy

IBC is treated with systemic (drug) therapy to shrink the tumor, followed by surgery to remove the breast and lymph nodes, and then radiation therapy. Surgery is not always possible. Even though surgery might not be an option, systemic therapy will continue. Systemic treatment is based on estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 expression.

Many factors play a role in how the cancer will respond to treatment. It is important to have regular talks with your care team about your goals for treatment and your treatment plan.

## Mastectomy

Surgery is an operation or procedure to remove cancer from the body. A mastectomy removes all or part of the breast. Inflammatory breast cancer is often treated with a modified radical mastectomy. In a modified radical mastectomy, the breast and underarm (axilla) sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are removed. Before removing the breast, the surgeon may do a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Sentinel lymph nodes are the first lymph nodes cancer cells are likely to have spread from the primary tumor.

Breast reconstruction is an option after a mastectomy. If you opt for reconstruction, it will be done after finishing cancer treatment. This is called delayed reconstruction. Breast reconstruction is often done in stages. You might want to consult with a plastic surgeon.

When preparing for surgery, seek the opinion of an experienced surgeon. The surgeon should be an expert in performing your type of surgery. Hospitals that perform many surgeries often have better results. You can ask for a referral to a hospital or cancer center that has experience in treating your type of cancer.

## Lymph node surgery

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy

Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB or SNB) is done during a lumpectomy or mastectomy to determine if any cancer cells have traveled to the lymph nodes. The lymph nodes removed are called the sentinel nodes.

A sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the first lymph node or nodes that cancer cells are most likely to spread to from a primary tumor. Often, there is more than one sentinel lymph node. Just because these nodes are removed, it does not mean that they test positive for cancer.

To find the sentinel lymph nodes, a dye is injected into the breast. It may be a radioactive material, blue dye, or other tracer. The tracer travels through the lymph channels in the breast to the lymph nodes in the armpit. This helps the surgeon find which of the lymph nodes are the sentinel lymph nodes. The lymph nodes containing the tracer are removed and tested by a pathologist.

### Axillary lymph node dissection

Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is surgery to remove axillary lymph nodes. This is performed after an axillary lymph node biopsy or SLNB shows cancer in the lymph nodes (called node positive). Then, an ALND will remove any other lymph nodes that contain cancer. Removing lymph nodes can cause lymphedema (fluid buildup) and other health issues.

When the axillary nodes are removed with the breast, it is called a modified radical mastectomy.

There are 3 levels of axillary lymph nodes:

  * **Level I** – nodes located below the lower edge of the chest muscle
  * **Level II** – nodes located underneath the chest muscle
  * **Level III** – nodes located above the chest muscle near the collarbone

An ALND usually removes level I and II axillary lymph nodes. For more information about the timing of biopsies, talk with your care team.

## Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy radiation from x-rays (photons), protons, and other sources to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Radiation therapy can be given alone or before or after surgery to treat or slow cancer growth. Sometimes, radiation is given with certain systemic (drug) therapies. It may be used as supportive care to help ease pain or discomfort caused by cancer. Treatment is given in small daily doses on weekdays, with weekends off.

You will see your radiation oncologist at least weekly to review treatment results and to help with side effects, such as sunburn-like rash. Ask your care team which radiation option(s) are best for your situation, if RT will be combined with chemotherapy, and what side effects to expect.

The following are types of radiation therapy used to treat breast cancer:

  * **Whole breast radiation therapy (WBRT)** is used to treat the entire breast.
  * **Lymph node radiation therapy** is used to treat the lymph nodes. It is also called regional nodal irradiation (RNI).

Radiation may be given to the breast and chest wall, infraclavicular region (below the collarbone), supraclavicular area (above the collarbone), or lymph nodes found inside the breast (intramammary), behind the ribcage (internal mammary), or axillary bed (armpit).

### External beam radiation therapy

External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) uses a machine outside of the body called a linear accelerator (linac) to aim radiation at the whole breast (called whole breast radiation therapy or WBRT) and lymph nodes (called regional nodal irradiation or RNI).

## Systemic therapy

Systemic therapy is drug therapy that works throughout the body. It is used before surgery to shrink the tumor or reduce the amount of cancer (called cancer burden).

> **Preoperative or neoadjuvant therapy** is systemic therapy given before surgery.
> **Postoperative or adjuvant therapy** is systemic therapy given after surgery.

### Treatment options

Systemic treatment options are often described in the following ways:

  * **Preferred therapies** have the most evidence they work better and may be safer than other therapies.
  * **Other recommended therapies** may not work quite as well as preferred therapies, but they can still help treat cancer.
  * **Therapies used in certain cases** work best for people with specific cancer features or health circumstances.

For a general list of systemic therapies, **see Guide 2**.

## Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells throughout the body, including cancer cells and some normal cells. More than one chemotherapy may be used to treat inflammatory breast cancer. When only one drug is used, it's called a single agent. A combination or multi-agent regimen is the use of two or more chemotherapy drugs.

Some chemotherapy drugs are liquids given through a vein (IV) or injected under the skin with a needle. Other chemotherapy drugs may be given as a pill that is swallowed.

Some examples of chemotherapy drugs include the following:

  * **Anthracyclines** include doxorubicin (Adriamycin), doxorubicin liposomal injection (Doxil), and epirubicin (Ellence).
  * **Taxanes** include docetaxel, paclitaxel, and albumin-bound paclitaxel.
  * **Antimetabolites** include capecitabine (Xeloda), fluorouracil, gemcitabine, and methotrexate.

Most chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment days followed by days of rest. This allows the body to recover before the next cycle. Cycles vary in length depending on which drugs are used. The number of treatment days per cycle and the total number of cycles given also vary.

## Antibody drug conjugates

An antibody drug conjugate (ADC) delivers cell-specific chemotherapy. It attaches to a protein found on the outside of the cancer cell, then enters the cell. Once inside the cell, chemotherapy is released. ADCs are given in cycles. ADC examples include ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla), fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (Enhertu, T-DXd), and sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (Trodelvy).

## HER2-targeted therapy

HER2 is a protein involved in normal cell growth. There might be higher amounts of HER2 in your breast cancer. If this is the case, it is called HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer. HER2-targeted therapy is drug therapy that treats HER2+ breast cancer. Some HER2-targeted therapy is given with chemotherapy. However, it might be used alone or in combination with endocrine therapy.

HER2-targeted therapies include:

  * **HER2 antibodies** prevent HER2 growth signals from outside the cell. They also increase the attack of immune cells on cancer cells.
  * **HER2 inhibitors** stop HER2 growth signals from within the cell.
  * **HER2 conjugates or HER2 antibody drug conjugates (ADCs)** deliver cell-specific chemotherapy. They attach directly to HER2s then enter the cell. Once inside, chemotherapy is released.

Your heart will be monitored before and during treatment with HER2-targeted therapy. Tests will measure the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), the amount of blood pumping from the left side of the heart.

### Warnings about supplements and drug interactions

You might be asked to stop taking or avoid certain herbal supplements when on a systemic therapy. Some supplements can affect the ability of a drug to do its job. This is called a drug interaction.

**It is critical to speak with your care team about any supplements you may be taking. Some examples include:**

  * Turmeric
  * Ginkgo biloba
  * Green tea extract
  * St. John's Wort
  * Antioxidants

Certain medicines can also affect the ability of a drug to do its job. Antacids, heart or blood pressure medicine, and antidepressants are just some of the medicines that might interact with a systemic therapy or supportive care medicines given during systemic therapy. Therefore, it is very important to tell your care team about any medicines, vitamins, over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, herbals, or supplements you are taking.

**Bring a list with you to every visit.**

## Other targeted therapies

This section is for inhibitors that are different from inhibitors used in HER2-targeted therapy.

### CDK4/6 inhibitors

Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) is a cell protein that helps cells grow and divide. For hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) cancer, taking a CDK4/6 inhibitor with endocrine therapy may help control cancer longer and improve survival. With all CDK4/6 regimens, those who are premenopausal must also receive ovarian ablation or suppression. CDK4/6 inhibitors include abemaciclib (Verzenio), palbociclib (Ibrance), and ribociclib (Kisqali).

### PARP inhibitors

Cancer cells often become damaged. PARP is a cell protein that repairs cancer cells and allows them to survive. Blocking PARP can cause cancer cells to die. Olaparib (Lynparza) and talazoparib (Talzenna) are examples of a PARP inhibitor (PARPi).

### PIK3CA, PTEN, and AKT1 inhibitors

The *PIK3CA* gene is one of the most frequently mutated genes in breast cancers. *PTEN* and *AKT* are also part of this important pathway in cancer cells and can be altered less commonly in breast cancers. A mutation or alteration in these genes can lead to increased growth of cancer cells and resistance to various treatments. Alpelisib (Piqray) is an example of a PIK3CA inhibitor and capivasertib (Truqap) is an AKT1 inhibitor.

### mTOR inhibitors

mTOR is a cell protein that helps cells grow and divide. Endocrine therapy may stop working if mTOR becomes overactive. mTOR inhibitors are used to get endocrine therapy working again.

Everolimus (Afinitor) is an mTOR inhibitor. Most often, it is taken with exemestane. For some, it may be taken with fulvestrant or tamoxifen.

## Immunotherapy

Immunotherapy is a type of systemic treatment that tries to reactivate the immune system against tumor cells. The immune system has many on and off switches. Tumors take advantage of off switches. Immunotherapy can block these off switches, which helps the immune system turn on. Immunotherapy can be given alone or with other types of treatment. Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and dostarlimab-gxly (Jemperli) are examples of immunotherapy.

## Endocrine therapy

Endocrine therapy blocks estrogen or progesterone to treat hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. The endocrine system is made up of organs and tissues that produce hormones. Hormones are natural chemicals released into the bloodstream.

There are 4 hormones that might be targeted in endocrine therapy:

  * **Estrogen** is made mainly by the ovaries, but is also made by other tissues in the body such as fat tissue.
  * **Progesterone** is made mainly by the ovaries.
  * **Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH)** is made by a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. It tells the ovaries to make estrogen and progesterone and testicles to make testosterone. LHRH is also called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).
  * **Androgen** is made by the adrenal glands, testicles, and ovaries.

Hormones may cause breast cancer to grow. Endocrine therapy will stop your body from making hormones or it will block what hormones do in the body. This can slow tumor growth or shrink the tumor for a period of time.

Endocrine therapy is sometimes called hormone therapy or anti-estrogen. It is not the same as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) used for menopause.

Endocrine therapy will suppress the production of hormones and affect one's ability to become pregnant during treatment. Those who want to have children in the future should be referred to a fertility specialist before starting endocrine therapy.

Types of endocrine therapy can be found in **Guide 3.**

### Testosterone

For those assigned male at birth whose bodies continue to make testosterone, endocrine therapy includes tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor (AI) with a testosterone-suppressing therapy.

### Premenopause

If you have menstrual periods, you are in premenopause. In premenopause, the ovaries are the main source of estrogen and progesterone.

GnRH agonists may be used to temporarily induce menopause for those in premenopause. A combination of GnRH agonists and tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors may be considered as endocrine therapy for those in premenopause. Ovarian suppression or ablation is frequently considered for higher risk ER+ breast cancers.

### Menopause

In menopause, the ovaries permanently stop producing hormones and menstrual periods stop. Estrogen and progesterone levels are low, but the adrenal glands, liver, and body fat continue to make small amounts of estrogen. If you don't have periods, a test using a blood sample may be used to confirm your status.

Cancer treatment can cause a temporary menopause. If you stopped having periods due to removal of your uterus (hysterectomy) but you still have your ovaries, then you should have your menopausal status confirmed with a blood test. If both ovaries have been removed (with or without your uterus), you are in menopause.

| Guide 3 Endocrine therapy types | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Bilateral oophorectomy** | Surgery to remove both ovaries. |
| **Ovarian ablation** | Radiation to permanently stop the ovaries from making hormones. |
| **Ovarian or testosterone suppression** | Drugs to temporarily stop the ovaries or testicles from making hormones such as LHRH and GnRH. LHRH agonists include goserelin (Zoladex) and leuprolide (Lupron Depot). These are injected every 4 or 12 weeks. They do not affect estrogen made by the ovaries. GnRH agonists might be used to suppress ovarian hormone or testosterone production. |
| **Aromatase inhibitors (AIs)** | Drugs to stop a type of hormone called androgen from changing into estrogen by interfering with an enzyme called aromatase. They do not affect estrogen made by the ovaries. Nonsteroidal AIs include anastrozole (Arimidex) and letrozole (Femara). Exemestane (Aromasin) is a steroidal AI. |
| **Estrogen receptor (ER) modulators or anti-estrogens** | • **Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)** block estrogen from attaching to hormone receptors. Tamoxifen and toremifene (Fareston) are SERMs. <br> • **Selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs)** block and destroy estrogen receptors. Fulvestrant (Faslodex) and elacestrant (Orserdu) are SERDs. |
| **Hormones** | Hormone examples include ethinyl estradiol, fluoxymesterone, and megestrol acetate (Megace). |

## Bone-strengthening therapy

Medicines that target the bones may be given to help relieve bone pain or reduce the risk of bone-related problems. Some medicines work by slowing or stopping bone breakdown, while others help increase bone thickness.

When breast cancer spreads to distant sites, it may metastasize in your bones. This puts your bones at risk for injury and disease. Such problems include fractures, bone pain, high calcium levels in the blood, and squeezing (compression) of the spinal cord. Some treatments for breast cancer, like aromatase inhibitors or GnRH agonists, can cause bone loss (osteoporosis), which puts you at an increased risk for fractures.

Drugs used to prevent bone loss and fractures:

  * Oral bisphosphonates
  * Zoledronic acid (Zometa)
  * Pamidronate (Aredia)
  * Denosumab (Prolia)

Drugs used to treat bone metastases:

  * Zoledronic acid (Zometa)
  * Pamidronate (Aredia)
  * Denosumab (Xgeva)

You may be screened for bone weakness (osteoporosis) using a bone mineral density test. This measures how much calcium and other minerals are in your bones. It is also called a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan and is painless. Bone mineral density tests look for osteoporosis and help predict your risk for bone fractures.

> Standard of care is the best known way to treat a particular disease based on past clinical trials. There may be more than one treatment regimen that is considered standard of care. Ask your care team what treatment options are available and if a clinical trial might be right for you.

### Zoledronic acid, pamidronate, and denosumab

Zoledronic acid, pamidronate, and denosumab are used to prevent bone loss (osteoporosis) and fractures caused by endocrine therapy. Zoledronic acid and denosumab are also used in those with metastatic inflammatory breast cancer who have bone metastases to help reduce the likelihood of fractures, pain, or other complications arising from cancer in bone. You might have blood tests to monitor kidney function, calcium levels, and magnesium levels. A calcium and vitamin D supplement will likely be recommended by your doctor.

Let your dentist know if you are taking any of these medicines. Also, ask your care team how these medicines might affect your teeth and jaw. Osteonecrosis, or bone tissue death of the jaw, is a rare but serious side effect. Tell your care team about any planned trips to the dentist and surgeries or dental procedures that might also affect the jawbone. It will be important to take care of your teeth and to see a dentist before starting treatment with any of these drugs.

## Clinical trials

A clinical trial is a type of medical research study. After being developed and tested in a lab, potential new ways of treating cancer need to be studied in people. If found to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a drug, device, or treatment approach may be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Everyone with cancer should carefully consider all of the treatment options available for their cancer type, including standard treatments and clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether a clinical trial may make sense for you.

### Phases

Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment and are done in phases.

  * **Phase 1** trials study the safety and side effects of an investigational drug or treatment approach.
  * **Phase 2** trials study how well the drug or approach works against a specific type of cancer.
  * **Phase 3** trials test the drug or approach against a standard treatment. If the results are good, it may be approved by the FDA.
  * **Phase 4** trials study the safety and benefit of an FDA-approved treatment.

### Who can enroll?

It depends on the clinical trial's rules, called eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age, cancer type and stage, treatment history, or general health. They ensure that participants are alike in specific ways and that the trial is as safe as possible for the participants.

### Informed consent

Clinical trials are managed by a research team. This group of experts will review the study with you in detail, including its purpose and the risks and benefits of joining. All of this information is also provided in an informed consent form. Read the form carefully and ask questions before signing it. Take time to discuss it with people you trust. Keep in mind that you can leave and seek treatment outside of the clinical trial at any time.

### Will I get a placebo?

Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines) are almost never used alone in cancer clinical trials. It is common to receive either a placebo with a standard treatment, or a new drug with a standard treatment. You will be informed, verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a clinical trial before you enroll.

### Are clinical trials free?

There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The study sponsor pays for research-related costs, including the study drug. But you may need to pay for other services, like transportation or childcare, due to extra appointments. During the trial, you will continue to receive standard cancer care. This care is often covered by insurance.

## Key points

  * Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is treated with systemic therapy to shrink the tumor, followed by a mastectomy, and radiation therapy. Surgery is not always possible. Even though surgery might not be an option, systemic therapy will continue. Systemic treatment is based on estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 expression.
  * Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy radiation from x-rays (photons, electrons), protons, and other sources to kill cancer cells.
  * Some breast cancers grow because of estrogen. These cancers are estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and are often treated with endocrine therapy to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence.
  * A clinical trial is a type of research that studies a treatment to see how safe it is and how well it works.

## Questions to ask

  * What is your experience treating inflammatory breast cancer?
  * How many breast cancer surgeries have you done?
  * What treatment will I have before and after surgery?
  * Is there a social worker or someone who can help me decide about treatment?
  * Who will coordinate my care?
